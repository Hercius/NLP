playing
pilgrims
christmas
won
t
be
christmas
without
any
presents
,
grumbled
jo
,
lying
on
the
rug
.
it
s
so
dreadful
to
be
poor
!
sighed
meg
,
looking
down
at
her
old
dress
.
i
don
t
think
it
s
fair
for
some
girls
to
have
plenty
of
pretty
things
,
and
other
girls
nothing
at
all
,
added
little
amy
,
with
an
injured
sniff
.
we
ve
got
father
and
mother
,
and
each
other
,
said
beth
contentedly
from
her
corner
.
the
four
young
faces
on
which
the
firelight
shone
brightened
at
the
cheerful
words
,
but
darkened
again
as
jo
said
sadly
,
we
haven
t
got
father
,
and
shall
not
have
him
for
a
long
time
.
she
didn
t
say
perhaps
never
,
but
each
silently
added
it
,
thinking
of
father
far
away
,
where
the
fighting
was
.
nobody
spoke
for
a
minute
then
meg
said
in
an
altered
tone
,
you
know
the
reason
mother
proposed
not
having
any
presents
this
christmas
was
because
it
is
going
to
be
a
hard
winter
for
everyone
and
she
thinks
we
ought
not
to
spend
money
for
pleasure
,
when
our
men
are
suffering
so
in
the
army
.
we
can
t
do
much
,
but
we
can
make
our
little
sacrifices
,
and
ought
to
do
it
gladly
.
but
i
am
afraid
i
don
t
,
and
meg
shook
her
head
,
as
she
thought
regretfully
of
all
the
pretty
things
she
wanted
.
but
i
don
t
think
the
little
we
should
spend
would
do
any
good
.
we
ve
each
got
a
dollar
,
and
the
army
wouldn
t
be
much
helped
by
our
giving
that
.
i
agree
not
to
expect
anything
from
mother
or
you
,
but
i
do
want
to
buy
undine
and
sintran
for
myself
.
i
ve
wanted
it
so
long
,
said
jo
,
who
was
a
bookworm
.
i
planned
to
spend
mine
in
new
music
,
said
beth
,
with
a
little
sigh
,
which
no
one
heard
but
the
hearth
brush
and
kettle
holder
.
i
shall
get
a
nice
box
of
faber
s
drawing
pencils
i
really
need
them
,
said
amy
decidedly
.
mother
didn
t
say
anything
about
our
money
,
and
she
won
t
wish
us
to
give
up
everything
.
let
s
each
buy
what
we
want
,
and
have
a
little
fun
i
m
sure
we
work
hard
enough
to
earn
it
,
cried
jo
,
examining
the
heels
of
her
shoes
in
a
gentlemanly
manner
.
i
know
i
do
teaching
those
tiresome
children
nearly
all
day
,
when
i
m
longing
to
enjoy
myself
at
home
,
began
meg
,
in
the
complaining
tone
again
.
you
don
t
have
half
such
a
hard
time
as
i
do
,
said
jo
.
how
would
you
like
to
be
shut
up
for
hours
with
a
nervous
,
fussy
old
lady
,
who
keeps
you
trotting
,
is
never
satisfied
,
and
worries
you
till
you
re
ready
to
fly
out
the
window
or
cry
?
it
s
naughty
to
fret
,
but
i
do
think
washing
dishes
and
keeping
things
tidy
is
the
worst
work
in
the
world
.
it
makes
me
cross
,
and
my
hands
get
so
stiff
,
i
can
t
practice
well
at
all
.
and
beth
looked
at
her
rough
hands
with
a
sigh
that
any
one
could
hear
that
time
.
i
don
t
believe
any
of
you
suffer
as
i
do
,
cried
amy
,
for
you
don
t
have
to
go
to
school
with
impertinent
girls
,
who
plague
you
if
you
don
t
know
your
lessons
,
and
laugh
at
your
dresses
,
and
label
your
father
if
he
isn
t
rich
,
and
insult
you
when
your
nose
isn
t
nice
.
if
you
mean
libel
,
i
d
say
so
,
and
not
talk
about
labels
,
as
if
papa
was
a
pickle
bottle
,
advised
jo
,
laughing
.
i
know
what
i
mean
,
and
you
needn
t
be
statirical
about
it
.
it
s
proper
to
use
good
words
,
and
improve
your
vocabilary
,
returned
amy
,
with
dignity
.
don
t

children
.
don
t
you
wish
we
had
the
money
papa
lost
when
we
were
little
,
jo
?
dear
me
!
how
happy
and
good
we
d
be
,
if
we
had
no
worries
!
said
meg
,
who
could
remember
better
times
.
you
said
the
other
day
you
thought
we
were
a
deal
happier
than
the
king
children
,
for
they
were
fighting
and
fretting
all
the
time
,
in
spite
of
their
money
.
so
i
did
,
beth
.
well
,
i
think
we
are
.
for
though
we
do
have
to
work
,
we
make
fun
of
ourselves
,
and
are
a
pretty
jolly
set
,
as
jo
would
say
.
jo
does
use
such
slang
words
!
observed
amy
,
with
a
reproving
look
at
the
long
figure
stretched
on
the
rug
.
jo
immediately
sat
up
,
put
her
hands
in
her
pockets
,
and
began
to
whistle
.
don
t
,
jo
.
it
s
so
boyish
!
that
s
why
i
do
it
.
i
detest
rude
,
unladylike
girls
!
i
hate
affected
,
niminy
piminy
chits
!
birds
in
their
little
nests
agree
,
sang
beth
,
the
peacemaker
,
with
such
a
funny
face
that
both
sharp
voices
softened
to
a
laugh
,
and
the
pecking
ended
for
that
time
.
really
,
girls
,
you
are
both
to
be
blamed
,
said
meg
,
beginning
to
lecture
in
her
elder
sisterly
fashion
.
you
are
old
enough
to
leave
off
boyish
tricks
,
and
to
behave
better
,
josephine
.
it
didn
t
matter
so
much
when
you
were
a
little
girl
,
but
now
you
are
so
tall
,
and
turn
up
your
hair
,
you
should
remember
that
you
are
a
young
lady
.
i
m
not
!
and
if
turning
up
my
hair
makes
me
one
,
i
ll
wear
it
in
two
tails
till
i
m
twenty
,
cried
jo
,
pulling
off
her
net
,
and
shaking
down
a
chestnut
mane
.
i
hate
to
think
i
ve
got
to
grow
up
,
and
be
miss
march
,
and
wear
long
gowns
,
and
look
as
prim
as
a
china
aster
!
it
s
bad
enough
to
be
a
girl
,
anyway
,
when
i
like
boy
s
games
and
work
and
manners
!
i
can
t
get
over
my
disappointment
in
not
being
a
boy
.
and
it
s
worse
than
ever
now
,
for
i
m
dying
to
go
and
fight
with
papa
.
and
i
can
only
stay
home
and
knit
,
like
a
poky
old
woman
!
and
jo
shook
the
blue
army
sock
till
the
needles
rattled
like
castanets
,
and
her
ball
bounded
across
the
room
.
poor
jo
!
it
s
too
bad
,
but
it
can
t
be
helped
.
so
you
must
try
to
be
contented
with
making
your
name
boyish
,
and
playing
brother
to
us
girls
,
said
beth
,
stroking
the
rough
head
with
a
hand
that
all
the
dish
washing
and
dusting
in
the
world
could
not
make
ungentle
in
its
touch
.
as
for
you
,
amy
,
continued
meg
,
you
are
altogether
too
particular
and
prim
.
your
airs
are
funny
now
,
but
you
ll
grow
up
an
affected
little
goose
,
if
you
don
t
take
care
.
i
like
your
nice
manners
and
refined
ways
of
speaking
,
when
you
don
t
try
to
be
elegant
.
but
your
absurd
words
are
as
bad
as
jo
s
slang
.
if
jo
is
a
tomboy
and
amy
a
goose
,
what
am
i
,
please
?
asked
beth
,
ready
to
share
the
lecture
.
you
re
a
dear
,
and
nothing
else
,
answered
meg
warmly
,
and
no
one
contradicted
her
,
for
the
mouse
was
the
pet
of
the
family
.
as
young
readers
like
to
know
how
people
look
,
we
will
take
this
moment
to
give
them
a
little
sketch
of
the
four
sisters
,
who
sat
knitting
away
in
the
twilight
,
while
the
december
snow
fell
quietly
without
,
and
the
fire
crackled
cheerfully
within
.
it
was
a
comfortable
room
,
though
the
carpet
was
faded
and
the
furniture
very
plain
,
for
a
good
picture
or
two
hung
on
the
walls
,
books
filled
the
recesses
,
chrysanthemums
and
christmas
roses
bloomed
in
the
windows
,
and
a
pleasant
atmosphere
of
home
peace
pervaded
it
.
margaret
,
the
eldest
of
the
four
,
was
sixteen
,
and
very
pretty
,
being
plump
and
fair
,
with
large
eyes
,
plenty
of
soft
brown
hair
,
a
sweet
mouth
,
and
white
hands
,
of
which
she
was
rather
vain
.
fifteen
year
old
jo
was
very
tall
,
thin
,
and
brown
,
and
reminded
one
of
a
colt
,
for
she
never
seemed
to
know
what
to
do
with
her
long
limbs
,
which
were
very
much
in
her
way
.
she
had
a
decided
mouth
,
a
comical
nose
,
and
sharp
,
gray
eyes
,
which
appeared
to
see
everything
,
and
were
by
turns
fierce
,
funny
,
or
thoughtful
.
her
long
,
thick
hair
was
her
one
beauty
,
but
it
was
usually
bundled
into
a
net
,
to
be
out
of
her
way
.
round
shoulders
had
jo
,
big
hands
and
feet
,
a
flyaway
look
to
her
clothes
,
and
the
uncomfortable
appearance
of
a
girl
who
was
rapidly
shooting
up
into
a
woman
and
didn
t
like
it
.
elizabeth
,
or
beth
,
as
everyone
called
her
,
was
a
rosy
,
smooth
haired
,
bright
eyed
girl
of
thirteen
,
with
a
shy
manner
,
a
timid
voice
,
and
a
peaceful
expression
which
was
seldom
disturbed
.
her
father
called
her
little
miss
tranquility
,
and
the
name
suited
her
excellently
,
for
she
seemed
to
live
in
a
happy
world
of
her
own
,
only
venturing
out
to
meet
the
few
whom
she
trusted
and
loved
.
amy
,
though
the
youngest
,
was
a
most
important
person
,
in
her
own
opinion
at
least
.
a
regular
snow
maiden
,
with
blue
eyes
,
and
yellow
hair
curling
on
her
shoulders
,
pale
and
slender
,
and
always
carrying
herself
like
a
young
lady
mindful
of
her
manners
.
what
the
characters
of
the
four
sisters
were
we
will
leave
to
be
found
out
.
the
clock
struck
six
and
,
having
swept
up
the
hearth
,
beth
put
a
pair
of
slippers
down
to
warm
.
somehow
the
sight
of
the
old
shoes
had
a
good
effect
upon
the
girls
,
for
mother
was
coming
,
and
everyone
brightened
to
welcome
her
.
meg
stopped
lecturing
,
and
lighted
the
lamp
,
amy
got
out
of
the
easy
chair
without
being
asked
,
and
jo
forgot
how
tired
she
was
as
she
sat
up
to
hold
the
slippers
nearer
to
the
blaze
.
they
are
quite
worn
out
.
marmee
must
have
a
new
pair
.
i
thought
i
d
get
her
some
with
my
dollar
,
said
beth
.
no
,
i
shall
!
cried
amy
.
i
m
the
oldest
,
began
meg
,
but
jo
cut
in
with
a
decided
,
i
m
the
man
of
the
family
now
papa
is
away
,
and
i
shall
provide
the
slippers
,
for
he
told
me
to
take
special
care
of
mother
while
he
was
gone
.
i
ll
tell
you
what
we
ll
do
,
said
beth
,
let
s
each
get
her
something
for
christmas
,
and
not
get
anything
for
ourselves
.
that
s
like
you
,
dear
!
what
will
we
get
?
exclaimed
jo
.
everyone
thought
soberly
for
a
minute
,
then
meg
announced
,
as
if
the
idea
was
suggested
by
the
sight
of
her
own
pretty
hands
,
i
shall
give
her
a
nice
pair
of
gloves
.
army
shoes
,
best
to
be
had
,
cried
jo
.
some
handkerchiefs
,
all
hemmed
,
said
beth
.
i
ll
get
a
little
bottle
of
cologne
.
she
likes
it
,
and
it
won
t
cost
much
,
so
i
ll
have
some
left
to
buy
my
pencils
,
added
amy
.
how
will
we
give
the
things
?
asked
meg
.
put
them
on
the
table
,
and
bring
her
in
and
see
her
open
the
bundles
.
don
t
you
remember
how
we
used
to
do
on
our
birthdays
?
answered
jo
.
i
used
to
be
so
frightened
when
it
was
my
turn
to
sit
in
the
chair
with
the
crown
on
,
and
see
you
all
come
marching
round
to
give
the
presents
,
with
a
kiss
.
i
liked
the
things
and
the
kisses
,
but
it
was
dreadful
to
have
you
sit
looking
at
me
while
i
opened
the
bundles
,
said
beth
,
who
was
toasting
her
face
and
the
bread
for
tea
at
the
same
time
.
let
marmee
think
we
are
getting
things
for
ourselves
,
and
then
surprise
her
.
we
must
go
shopping
tomorrow
afternoon
,
meg
.
there
is
so
much
to
do
about
the
play
for
christmas
night
,
said
jo
,
marching
up
and
down
,
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
,
and
her
nose
in
the
air
.
i
don
t
mean
to
act
any
more
after
this
time
.
i
m
getting
too
old
for
such
things
,
observed
meg
,
who
was
as
much
a
child
as
ever
about
dressing
up
frolics
.
you
won
t
stop
,
i
know
,
as
long
as
you
can
trail
round
in
a
white
gown
with
your
hair
down
,
and
wear
gold
paper
jewelry
.
you
are
the
best
actress
we
ve
got
,
and
there
ll
be
an
end
of
everything
if
you
quit
the
boards
,
said
jo
.
we
ought
to
rehearse
tonight
.
come
here
,
amy
,
and
do
the
fainting
scene
,
for
you
are
as
stiff
as
a
poker
in
that
.
i
can
t
help
it
.
i
never
saw
anyone
faint
,
and
i
don
t
choose
to
make
myself
all
black
and
blue
,
tumbling
flat
as
you
do
.
if
i
can
go
down
easily
,
i
ll
drop
.
if
i
can
t
,
i
shall
fall
into
a
chair
and
be
graceful
.
i
don
t
care
if
hugo
does
come
at
me
with
a
pistol
,
returned
amy
,
who
was
not
gifted
with
dramatic
power
,
but
was
chosen
because
she
was
small
enough
to
be
borne
out
shrieking
by
the
villain
of
the
piece
.
do
it
this
way
.
clasp
your
hands
so
,
and
stagger
across
the
room
,
crying
frantically
,
roderigo
!
save
me
!
save
me
!
and
away
went
jo
,
with
a
melodramatic
scream
which
was
truly
thrilling
.
amy
followed
,
but
she
poked
her
hands
out
stiffly
before
her
,
and
jerked
herself
along
as
if
she
went
by
machinery
,
and
her
ow
!
was
more
suggestive
of
pins
being
run
into
her
than
of
fear
and
anguish
.
jo
gave
a
despairing
groan
,
and
meg
laughed
outright
,
while
beth
let
her
bread
burn
as
she
watched
the
fun
with
interest
.
it
s
no
use
!
do
the
best
you
can
when
the
time
comes
,
and
if
the
audience
laughs
,
don
t
blame
me
.
come
on
,
meg
.
then
things
went
smoothly
,
for
don
pedro
defied
the
world
in
a
speech
of
two
pages
without
a
single
break
.
hagar
,
the
witch
,
chanted
an
awful
incantation
over
her
kettleful
of
simmering
toads
,
with
weird
effect
.
roderigo
rent
his
chains
asunder
manfully
,
and
hugo
died
in
agonies
of
remorse
and
arsenic
,
with
a
wild
,
ha
!
ha
!
it
s
the
best
we
ve
had
yet
,
said
meg
,
as
the
dead
villain
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
elbows
.
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
write
and
act
such
splendid
things
,
jo
.
you
re
a
regular
shakespeare
!
exclaimed
beth
,
who
firmly
believed
that
her
sisters
were
gifted
with
wonderful
genius
in
all
things
.
not
quite
,
replied
jo
modestly
.
i
do
think
the
witches
curse
,
an
operatic
tragedy
is
rather
a
nice
thing
,
but
i
d
like
to
try
macbeth
,
if
we
only
had
a
trapdoor
for
banquo
.
i
always
wanted
to
do
the
killing
part
.
is
that
a
dagger
that
i
see
before
me
?
muttered
jo
,
rolling
her
eyes
and
clutching
at
the
air
,
as
she
had
seen
a
famous
tragedian
do
.
no
,
it
s
the
toasting
fork
,
with
mother
s
shoe
on
it
instead
of
the
bread
.
beth
s
stage
struck
!
cried
meg
,
and
the
rehearsal
ended
in
a
general
burst
of
laughter
.
glad
to
find
you
so
merry
,
my
girls
,
said
a
cheery
voice
at
the
door
,
and
actors
and
audience
turned
to
welcome
a
tall
,
motherly
lady
with
a
can
i
help
you
look
about
her
which
was
truly
delightful
.
she
was
not
elegantly
dressed
,
but
a
noble
looking
woman
,
and
the
girls
thought
the
gray
cloak
and
unfashionable
bonnet
covered
the
most
splendid
mother
in
the
world
.
well
,
dearies
,
how
have
you
got
on
today
?
there
was
so
much
to
do
,
getting
the
boxes
ready
to
go
tomorrow
,
that
i
didn
t
come
home
to
dinner
.
has
anyone
called
,
beth
?
how
is
your
cold
,
meg
?
jo
,
you
look
tired
to
death
.
come
and
kiss
me
,
baby
.
while
making
these
maternal
inquiries
mrs
.
march
got
her
wet
things
off
,
her
warm
slippers
on
,
and
sitting
down
in
the
easy
chair
,
drew
amy
to
her
lap
,
preparing
to
enjoy
the
happiest
hour
of
her
busy
day
.
the
girls
flew
about
,
trying
to
make
things
comfortable
,
each
in
her
own
way
.
meg
arranged
the
tea
table
,
jo
brought
wood
and
set
chairs
,
dropping
,
over
turning
,
and
clattering
everything
she
touched
.
beth
trotted
to
and
fro
between
parlor
kitchen
,
quiet
and
busy
,
while
amy
gave
directions
to
everyone
,
as
she
sat
with
her
hands
folded
.
as
they
gathered
about
the
table
,
mrs
.
march
said
,
with
a
particularly
happy
face
,
i
ve
got
a
treat
for
you
after
supper
.
a
quick
,
bright
smile
went
round
like
a
streak
of
sunshine
.
beth
clapped
her
hands
,
regardless
of
the
biscuit
she
held
,
and
jo
tossed
up
her
napkin
,
crying
,
a
letter
!
a
letter
!
three
cheers
for
father
!
yes
,
a
nice
long
letter
.
he
is
well
,
and
thinks
he
shall
get
through
the
cold
season
better
than
we
feared
.
he
sends
all
sorts
of
loving
wishes
for
christmas
,
and
an
especial
message
to
you
girls
,
said
mrs
.
march
,
patting
her
pocket
as
if
she
had
got
a
treasure
there
.
hurry
and
get
done
!
don
t
stop
to
quirk
your
little
finger
and
simper
over
your
plate
,
amy
,
cried
jo
,
choking
on
her
tea
and
dropping
her
bread
,
butter
side
down
,
on
the
carpet
in
her
haste
to
get
at
the
treat
.
beth
ate
no
more
,
but
crept
away
to
sit
in
her
shadowy
corner
and
brood
over
the
delight
to
come
,
till
the
others
were
ready
.
i
think
it
was
so
splendid
in
father
to
go
as
chaplain
when
he
was
too
old
to
be
drafted
,
and
not
strong
enough
for
a
soldier
,
said
meg
warmly
.
don
t
i
wish
i
could
go
as
a
drummer
,
a
vivan
what
s
its
name
?
or
a
nurse
,
so
i
could
be
near
him
and
help
him
,
exclaimed
jo
,
with
a
groan
.
it
must
be
very
disagreeable
to
sleep
in
a
tent
,
and
eat
all
sorts
of
bad
tasting
things
,
and
drink
out
of
a
tin
mug
,
sighed
amy
.
when
will
he
come
home
,
marmee
?
asked
beth
,
with
a
little
quiver
in
her
voice
.
not
for
many
months
,
dear
,
unless
he
is
sick
.
he
will
stay
and
do
his
work
faithfully
as
long
as
he
can
,
and
we
won
t
ask
for
him
back
a
minute
sooner
than
he
can
be
spared
.
now
come
and
hear
the
letter
.
they
all
drew
to
the
fire
,
mother
in
the
big
chair
with
beth
at
her
feet
,
meg
and
amy
perched
on
either
arm
of
the
chair
,
and
jo
leaning
on
the
back
,
where
no
one
would
see
any
sign
of
emotion
if
the
letter
should
happen
to
be
touching
.
very
few
letters
were
written
in
those
hard
times
that
were
not
touching
,
especially
those
which
fathers
sent
home
.
in
this
one
little
was
said
of
the
hardships
endured
,
the
dangers
faced
,
or
the
homesickness
conquered
.
it
was
a
cheerful
,
hopeful
letter
,
full
of
lively
descriptions
of
camp
life
,
marches
,
and
military
news
,
and
only
at
the
end
did
the
writer
s
heart
over
flow
with
fatherly
love
and
longing
for
the
little
girls
at
home
.
give
them
all
of
my
dear
love
and
a
kiss
.
tell
them
i
think
of
them
by
day
,
pray
for
them
by
night
,
and
find
my
best
comfort
in
their
affection
at
all
times
.
a
year
seems
very
long
to
wait
before
i
see
them
,
but
remind
them
that
while
we
wait
we
may
all
work
,
so
that
these
hard
days
need
not
be
wasted
.
i
know
they
will
remember
all
i
said
to
them
,
that
they
will
be
loving
children
to
you
,
will
do
their
duty
faithfully
,
fight
their
bosom
enemies
bravely
,
and
conquer
themselves
so
beautifully
that
when
i
come
back
to
them
i
may
be
fonder
and
prouder
than
ever
of
my
little
women
.
everybody
sniffed
when
they
came
to
that
part
.
jo
wasn
t
ashamed
of
the
great
tear
that
dropped
off
the
end
of
her
nose
,
and
amy
never
minded
the
rumpling
of
her
curls
as
she
hid
her
face
on
her
mother
s
shoulder
and
sobbed
out
,
i
am
a
selfish
girl
!
but
i
ll
truly
try
to
be
better
,
so
he
mayn
t
be
disappointed
in
me
by
and
by
.
we
all
will
,
cried
meg
.
i
think
too
much
of
my
looks
and
hate
to
work
,
but
won
t
any
more
,
if
i
can
help
it
.
i
ll
try
and
be
what
he
loves
to
call
me
,
a
little
woman
and
not
be
rough
and
wild
,
but
do
my
duty
here
instead
of
wanting
to
be
somewhere
else
,
said
jo
,
thinking
that
keeping
her
temper
at
home
was
a
much
harder
task
than
facing
a
rebel
or
two
down
south
.
beth
said
nothing
,
but
wiped
away
her
tears
with
the
blue
army
sock
and
began
to
knit
with
all
her
might
,
losing
no
time
in
doing
the
duty
that
lay
nearest
her
,
while
she
resolved
in
her
quiet
little
soul
to
be
all
that
father
hoped
to
find
her
when
the
year
brought
round
the
happy
coming
home
.
mrs
.
march
broke
the
silence
that
followed
jo
s
words
,
by
saying
in
her
cheery
voice
,
do
you
remember
how
you
used
to
play
pilgrims
progress
when
you
were
little
things
?
nothing
delighted
you
more
than
to
have
me
tie
my
piece
bags
on
your
backs
for
burdens
,
give
you
hats
and
sticks
and
rolls
of
paper
,
and
let
you
travel
through
the
house
from
the
cellar
,
which
was
the
city
of
destruction
,
up
,
up
,
to
the
housetop
,
where
you
had
all
the
lovely
things
you
could
collect
to
make
a
celestial
city
.
what
fun
it
was
,
especially
going
by
the
lions
,
fighting
apollyon
,
and
passing
through
the
valley
where
the
hob
goblins
were
,
said
jo
.
i
liked
the
place
where
the
bundles
fell
off
and
tumbled
downstairs
,
said
meg
.
i
don
t
remember
much
about
it
,
except
that
i
was
afraid
of
the
cellar
and
the
dark
entry
,
and
always
liked
the
cake
and
milk
we
had
up
at
the
top
.
if
i
wasn
t
too
old
for
such
things
,
i
d
rather
like
to
play
it
over
again
,
said
amy
,
who
began
to
talk
of
renouncing
childish
things
at
the
mature
age
of
twelve
.
we
never
are
too
old
for
this
,
my
dear
,
because
it
is
a
play
we
are
playing
all
the
time
in
one
way
or
another
.
our
burdens
are
here
,
our
road
is
before
us
,
and
the
longing
for
goodness
and
happiness
is
the
guide
that
leads
us
through
many
troubles
and
mistakes
to
the
peace
which
is
a
true
celestial
city
.
now
,
my
little
pilgrims
,
suppose
you
begin
again
,
not
in
play
,
but
in
earnest
,
and
see
how
far
on
you
can
get
before
father
comes
home
.
really
,
mother
?
where
are
our
bundles
?
asked
amy
,
who
was
a
very
literal
young
lady
.
each
of
you
told
what
your
burden
was
just
now
,
except
beth
.
i
rather
think
she
hasn
t
got
any
,
said
her
mother
.
yes
,
i
have
.
mine
is
dishes
and
dusters
,
and
envying
girls
with
nice
pianos
,
and
being
afraid
of
people
.
beth
s
bundle
was
such
a
funny
one
that
everybody
wanted
to
laugh
,
but
nobody
did
,
for
it
would
have
hurt
her
feelings
very
much
.
let
us
do
it
,
said
meg
thoughtfully
.
it
is
only
another
name
for
trying
to
be
good
,
and
the
story
may
help
us
,
for
though
we
do
want
to
be
good
,
it
s
hard
work
and
we
forget
,
and
don
t
do
our
best
.
we
were
in
the
slough
of
despond
tonight
,
and
mother
came
and
pulled
us
out
as
help
did
in
the
book
.
we
ought
to
have
our
roll
of
directions
,
like
christian
.
what
shall
we
do
about
that
?
asked
jo
,
delighted
with
the
fancy
which
lent
a
little
romance
to
the
very
dull
task
of
doing
her
duty
.
look
under
your
pillows
christmas
morning
,
and
you
will
find
your
guidebook
,
replied
mrs
.
march
.
they
talked
over
the
new
plan
while
old
hannah
cleared
the
table
,
then
out
came
the
four
little
work
baskets
,
and
the
needles
flew
as
the
girls
made
sheets
for
aunt
march
.
it
was
uninteresting
sewing
,
but
tonight
no
one
grumbled
.
they
adopted
jo
s
plan
of
dividing
the
long
seams
into
four
parts
,
and
calling
the
quarters
europe
,
asia
,
africa
,
and
america
,
and
in
that
way
got
on
capitally
,
especially
when
they
talked
about
the
different
countries
as
they
stitched
their
way
through
them
.
at
nine
they
stopped
work
,
and
sang
,
as
usual
,
before
they
went
to
bed
.
no
one
but
beth
could
get
much
music
out
of
the
old
piano
,
but
she
had
a
way
of
softly
touching
the
yellow
keys
and
making
a
pleasant
accompaniment
to
the
simple
songs
they
sang
.
meg
had
a
voice
like
a
flute
,
and
she
and
her
mother
led
the
little
choir
.
amy
chirped
like
a
cricket
,
and
jo
wandered
through
the
airs
at
her
own
sweet
will
,
always
coming
out
at
the
wrong
place
with
a
croak
or
a
quaver
that
spoiled
the
most
pensive
tune
.
they
had
always
done
this
from
the
time
they
could
lisp
...
crinkle
,
crinkle
,
ittle
tar
,
and
it
had
become
a
household
custom
,
for
the
mother
was
a
born
singer
.
the
first
sound
in
the
morning
was
her
voice
as
she
went
about
the
house
singing
like
a
lark
,
and
the
last
sound
at
night
was
the
same
cheery
sound
,
for
the
girls
never
grew
too
old
for
that
familiar
lullaby
.
chapter
two
a
merry
christmas
jo
was
the
first
to
wake
in
the
gray
dawn
of
christmas
morning
.
no
stockings
hung
at
the
fireplace
,
and
for
a
moment
she
felt
as
much
disappointed
as
she
did
long
ago
,
when
her
little
sock
fell
down
because
it
was
crammed
so
full
of
goodies
.
then
she
remembered
her
mother
s
promise
and
,
slipping
her
hand
under
her
pillow
,
drew
out
a
little
crimson
covered
book
.
she
knew
it
very
well
,
for
it
was
that
beautiful
old
story
of
the
best
life
ever
lived
,
and
jo
felt
that
it
was
a
true
guidebook
for
any
pilgrim
going
on
a
long
journey
.
she
woke
meg
with
a
merry
christmas
,
and
bade
her
see
what
was
under
her
pillow
.
a
green
covered
book
appeared
,
with
the
same
picture
inside
,
and
a
few
words
written
by
their
mother
,
which
made
their
one
present
very
precious
in
their
eyes
.
presently
beth
and
amy
woke
to
rummage
and
find
their
little
books
also
,
one
dove
colored
,
the
other
blue
,
and
all
sat
looking
at
and
talking
about
them
,
while
the
east
grew
rosy
with
the
coming
day
.
in
spite
of
her
small
vanities
,
margaret
had
a
sweet
and
pious
nature
,
which
unconsciously
influenced
her
sisters
,
especially
jo
,
who
loved
her
very
tenderly
,
and
obeyed
her
because
her
advice
was
so
gently
given
.
girls
,
said
meg
seriously
,
looking
from
the
tumbled
head
beside
her
to
the
two
little
night
capped
ones
in
the
room
beyond
,
mother
wants
us
to
read
and
love
and
mind
these
books
,
and
we
must
begin
at
once
.
we
used
to
be
faithful
about
it
,
but
since
father
went
away
and
all
this
war
trouble
unsettled
us
,
we
have
neglected
many
things
.
you
can
do
as
you
please
,
but
i
shall
keep
my
book
on
the
table
here
and
read
a
little
every
morning
as
soon
as
i
wake
,
for
i
know
it
will
do
me
good
and
help
me
through
the
day
.
then
she
opened
her
new
book
and
began
to
read
.
jo
put
her
arm
round
her
and
,
leaning
cheek
to
cheek
,
read
also
,
with
the
quiet
expression
so
seldom
seen
on
her
restless
face
.
how
good
meg
is
!
come
,
amy
,
let
s
do
as
they
do
.
i
ll
help
you
with
the
hard
words
,
and
they
ll
explain
things
if
we
don
t
understand
,
whispered
beth
,
very
much
impressed
by
the
pretty
books
and
her
sisters
example
.
i
m
glad
mine
is
blue
,
said
amy
.
and
then
the
rooms
were
very
still
while
the
pages
were
softly
turned
,
and
the
winter
sunshine
crept
in
to
touch
the
bright
heads
and
serious
faces
with
a
christmas
greeting
.
where
is
mother
?
asked
meg
,
as
she
and
jo
ran
down
to
thank
her
for
their
gifts
,
half
an
hour
later
.
goodness
only
knows
.
some
poor
creeter
came
a
beggin
,
and
your
ma
went
straight
off
to
see
what
was
needed
.
there
never
was
such
a
woman
for
givin
away
vittles
and
drink
,
clothes
and
firin
,
replied
hannah
,
who
had
lived
with
the
family
since
meg
was
born
,
and
was
considered
by
them
all
more
as
a
friend
than
a
servant
.
she
will
be
back
soon
,
i
think
,
so
fry
your
cakes
,
and
have
everything
ready
,
said
meg
,
looking
over
the
presents
which
were
collected
in
a
basket
and
kept
under
the
sofa
,
ready
to
be
produced
at
the
proper
time
.
why
,
where
is
amy
s
bottle
of
cologne
?
she
added
,
as
the
little
flask
did
not
appear
.
she
took
it
out
a
minute
ago
,
and
went
off
with
it
to
put
a
ribbon
on
it
,
or
some
such
notion
,
replied
jo
,
dancing
about
the
room
to
take
the
first
stiffness
off
the
new
army
slippers
.
how
nice
my
handkerchiefs
look
,
don
t
they
?
hannah
washed
and
ironed
them
for
me
,
and
i
marked
them
all
myself
,
said
beth
,
looking
proudly
at
the
somewhat
uneven
letters
which
had
cost
her
such
labor
.
bless
the
child
!
she
s
gone
and
put
mother
on
them
instead
of
m
.
march
.
how
funny
!
cried
jo
,
taking
one
up
.
isn
t
that
right
?
i
thought
it
was
better
to
do
it
so
,
because
meg
s
initials
are
m
.m
.,
and
i
don
t
want
anyone
to
use
these
but
marmee
,
said
beth
,
looking
troubled
.
it
s
all
right
,
dear
,
and
a
very
pretty
idea
,
quite
sensible
too
,
for
no
one
can
ever
mistake
now
.
it
will
please
her
very
much
,
i
know
,
said
meg
,
with
a
frown
for
jo
and
a
smile
for
beth
.
there
s
mother
.
hide
the
basket
,
quick
!
cried
jo
,
as
a
door
slammed
and
steps
sounded
in
the
hall
.
amy
came
in
hastily
,
and
looked
rather
abashed
when
she
saw
her
sisters
all
waiting
for
her
.
where
have
you
been
,
and
what
are
you
hiding
behind
you
?
asked
meg
,
surprised
to
see
,
by
her
hood
and
cloak
,
that
lazy
amy
had
been
out
so
early
.
don
t
laugh
at
me
,
jo
!
i
didn
t
mean
anyone
should
know
till
the
time
came
.
i
only
meant
to
change
the
little
bottle
for
a
big
one
,
and
i
gave
all
my
money
to
get
it
,
and
i
m
truly
trying
not
to
be
selfish
any
more
.
as
she
spoke
,
amy
showed
the
handsome
flask
which
replaced
the
cheap
one
,
and
looked
so
earnest
and
humble
in
her
little
effort
to
forget
herself
that
meg
hugged
her
on
the
spot
,
and
jo
pronounced
her
a
trump
,
while
beth
ran
to
the
window
,
and
picked
her
finest
rose
to
ornament
the
stately
bottle
.
you
see
i
felt
ashamed
of
my
present
,
after
reading
and
talking
about
being
good
this
morning
,
so
i
ran
round
the
corner
and
changed
it
the
minute
i
was
up
,
and
i
m
so
glad
,
for
mine
is
the
handsomest
now
.
another
bang
of
the
street
door
sent
the
basket
under
the
sofa
,
and
the
girls
to
the
table
,
eager
for
breakfast
.
merry
christmas
,
marmee
!
many
of
them
!
thank
you
for
our
books
.
we
read
some
,
and
mean
to
every
day
,
they
all
cried
in
chorus
.
merry
christmas
,
little
daughters
!
i
m
glad
you
began
at
once
,
and
hope
you
will
keep
on
.
but
i
want
to
say
one
word
before
we
sit
down
.
not
far
away
from
here
lies
a
poor
woman
with
a
little
newborn
baby
.
six
children
are
huddled
into
one
bed
to
keep
from
freezing
,
for
they
have
no
fire
.
there
is
nothing
to
eat
over
there
,
and
the
oldest
boy
came
to
tell
me
they
were
suffering
hunger
and
cold
.
my
girls
,
will
you
give
them
your
breakfast
as
a
christmas
present
?
they
were
all
unusually
hungry
,
having
waited
nearly
an
hour
,
and
for
a
minute
no
one
spoke
,
only
a
minute
,
for
jo
exclaimed
impetuously
,
i
m
so
glad
you
came
before
we
began
!
may
i
go
and
help
carry
the
things
to
the
poor
little
children
?
asked
beth
eagerly
.
i
shall
take
the
cream
and
the
muffings
,
added
amy
,
heroically
giving
up
the
article
she
most
liked
.
meg
was
already
covering
the
buckwheats
,
and
piling
the
bread
into
one
big
plate
.
i
thought
you
d
do
it
,
said
mrs
.
march
,
smiling
as
if
satisfied
.
you
shall
all
go
and
help
me
,
and
when
we
come
back
we
will
have
bread
and
milk
for
breakfast
,
and
make
it
up
at
dinnertime
.
they
were
soon
ready
,
and
the
procession
set
out
.
fortunately
it
was
early
,
and
they
went
through
back
streets
,
so
few
people
saw
them
,
and
no
one
laughed
at
the
queer
party
.
a
poor
,
bare
,
miserable
room
it
was
,
with
broken
windows
,
no
fire
,
ragged
bedclothes
,
a
sick
mother
,
wailing
baby
,
and
a
group
of
pale
,
hungry
children
cuddled
under
one
old
quilt
,
trying
to
keep
warm
.
how
the
big
eyes
stared
and
the
blue
lips
smiled
as
the
girls
went
in
.
ach
,
mein
gott
!
it
is
good
angels
come
to
us
!
said
the
poor
woman
,
crying
for
joy
.
funny
angels
in
hoods
and
mittens
,
said
jo
,
and
set
them
to
laughing
.
in
a
few
minutes
it
really
did
seem
as
if
kind
spirits
had
been
at
work
there
.
hannah
,
who
had
carried
wood
,
made
a
fire
,
and
stopped
up
the
broken
panes
with
old
hats
and
her
own
cloak
.
mrs
.
march
gave
the
mother
tea
and
gruel
,
and
comforted
her
with
promises
of
help
,
while
she
dressed
the
little
baby
as
tenderly
as
if
it
had
been
her
own
.
the
girls
meantime
spread
the
table
,
set
the
children
round
the
fire
,
and
fed
them
like
so
many
hungry
birds
,
laughing
,
talking
,
and
trying
to
understand
the
funny
broken
english
.
das
ist
gut
!
die
engel
kinder
!
cried
the
poor
things
as
they
ate
and
warmed
their
purple
hands
at
the
comfortable
blaze
.
the
girls
had
never
been
called
angel
children
before
,
and
thought
it
very
agreeable
,
especially
jo
,
who
had
been
considered
a
sancho
ever
since
she
was
born
.
that
was
a
very
happy
breakfast
,
though
they
didn
t
get
any
of
it
.
and
when
they
went
away
,
leaving
comfort
behind
,
i
think
there
were
not
in
all
the
city
four
merrier
people
than
the
hungry
little
girls
who
gave
away
their
breakfasts
and
contented
themselves
with
bread
and
milk
on
christmas
morning
.
that
s
loving
our
neighbor
better
than
ourselves
,
and
i
like
it
,
said
meg
,
as
they
set
out
their
presents
while
their
mother
was
upstairs
collecting
clothes
for
the
poor
hummels
.
not
a
very
splendid
show
,
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
love
done
up
in
the
few
little
bundles
,
and
the
tall
vase
of
red
roses
,
white
chrysanthemums
,
and
trailing
vines
,
which
stood
in
the
middle
,
gave
quite
an
elegant
air
to
the
table
.
she
s
coming
!
strike
up
,
beth
!
open
the
door
,
amy
!
three
cheers
for
marmee
!
cried
jo
,
prancing
about
while
meg
went
to
conduct
mother
to
the
seat
of
honor
.
beth
played
her
gayest
march
,
amy
threw
open
the
door
,
and
meg
enacted
escort
with
great
dignity
.
mrs
.
march
was
both
surprised
and
touched
,
and
smiled
with
her
eyes
full
as
she
examined
her
presents
and
read
the
little
notes
which
accompanied
them
.
the
slippers
went
on
at
once
,
a
new
handkerchief
was
slipped
into
her
pocket
,
well
scented
with
amy
s
cologne
,
the
rose
was
fastened
in
her
bosom
,
and
the
nice
gloves
were
pronounced
a
perfect
fit
.
there
was
a
good
deal
of
laughing
and
kissing
and
explaining
,
in
the
simple
,
loving
fashion
which
makes
these
home
festivals
so
pleasant
at
the
time
,
so
sweet
to
remember
long
afterward
,
and
then
all
fell
to
work
.
the
morning
charities
and
ceremonies
took
so
much
time
that
the
rest
of
the
day
was
devoted
to
preparations
for
the
evening
festivities
.
being
still
too
young
to
go
often
to
the
theater
,
and
not
rich
enough
to
afford
any
great
outlay
for
private
performances
,
the
girls
put
their
wits
to
work
,
and
necessity
being
the
mother
of
invention
,
made
whatever
they
needed
.
very
clever
were
some
of
their
productions
,
pasteboard
guitars
,
antique
lamps
made
of
old
fashioned
butter
boats
covered
with
silver
paper
,
gorgeous
robes
of
old
cotton
,
glittering
with
tin
spangles
from
a
pickle
factory
,
and
armor
covered
with
the
same
useful
diamond
shaped
bits
left
in
sheets
when
the
lids
of
preserve
pots
were
cut
out
.
the
big
chamber
was
the
scene
of
many
innocent
revels
.
no
gentleman
were
admitted
,
so
jo
played
male
parts
to
her
heart
s
content
and
took
immense
satisfaction
in
a
pair
of
russet
leather
boots
given
her
by
a
friend
,
who
knew
a
lady
who
knew
an
actor
.
these
boots
,
an
old
foil
,
and
a
slashed
doublet
once
used
by
an
artist
for
some
picture
,
were
jo
s
chief
treasures
and
appeared
on
all
occasions
.
the
smallness
of
the
company
made
it
necessary
for
the
two
principal
actors
to
take
several
parts
apiece
,
and
they
certainly
deserved
some
credit
for
the
hard
work
they
did
in
learning
three
or
four
different
parts
,
whisking
in
and
out
of
various
costumes
,
and
managing
the
stage
besides
.
it
was
excellent
drill
for
their
memories
,
a
harmless
amusement
,
and
employed
many
hours
which
otherwise
would
have
been
idle
,
lonely
,
or
spent
in
less
profitable
society
.
on
christmas
night
,
a
dozen
girls
piled
onto
the
bed
which
was
the
dress
circle
,
and
sat
before
the
blue
and
yellow
chintz
curtains
in
a
most
flattering
state
of
expectancy
.
there
was
a
good
deal
of
rustling
and
whispering
behind
the
curtain
,
a
trifle
of
lamp
smoke
,
and
an
occasional
giggle
from
amy
,
who
was
apt
to
get
hysterical
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
.
presently
a
bell
sounded
,
the
curtains
flew
apart
,
and
the
operatic
tragedy
began
.
a
gloomy
wood
,
according
to
the
one
playbill
,
was
represented
by
a
few
shrubs
in
pots
,
green
baize
on
the
floor
,
and
a
cave
in
the
distance
.
this
cave
was
made
with
a
clothes
horse
for
a
roof
,
bureaus
for
walls
,
and
in
it
was
a
small
furnace
in
full
blast
,
with
a
black
pot
on
it
and
an
old
witch
bending
over
it
.
the
stage
was
dark
and
the
glow
of
the
furnace
had
a
fine
effect
,
especially
as
real
steam
issued
from
the
kettle
when
the
witch
took
off
the
cover
.
a
moment
was
allowed
for
the
first
thrill
to
subside
,
then
hugo
,
the
villain
,
stalked
in
with
a
clanking
sword
at
his
side
,
a
slouching
hat
,
black
beard
,
mysterious
cloak
,
and
the
boots
.
after
pacing
to
and
fro
in
much
agitation
,
he
struck
his
forehead
,
and
burst
out
in
a
wild
strain
,
singing
of
his
hatred
for
roderigo
,
his
love
for
zara
,
and
his
pleasing
resolution
to
kill
the
one
and
win
the
other
.
the
gruff
tones
of
hugo
s
voice
,
with
an
occasional
shout
when
his
feelings
overcame
him
,
were
very
impressive
,
and
the
audience
applauded
the
moment
he
paused
for
breath
.
bowing
with
the
air
of
one
accustomed
to
public
praise
,
he
stole
to
the
cavern
and
ordered
hagar
to
come
forth
with
a
commanding
,
what
ho
,
minion
!
i
need
thee
!
out
came
meg
,
with
gray
horsehair
hanging
about
her
face
,
a
red
and
black
robe
,
a
staff
,
and
cabalistic
signs
upon
her
cloak
.
hugo
demanded
a
potion
to
make
zara
adore
him
,
and
one
to
destroy
roderigo
.
hagar
,
in
a
fine
dramatic
melody
,
promised
both
,
and
proceeded
to
call
up
the
spirit
who
would
bring
the
love
philter
.
hither
,
hither
,
from
thy
home
,
airy
sprite
,
i
bid
thee
come
!
born
of
roses
,
fed
on
dew
,
charms
and
potions
canst
thou
brew
?
bring
me
here
,
with
elfin
speed
,
the
fragrant
philter
which
i
need
.
make
it
sweet
and
swift
and
strong
,
spirit
,
answer
now
my
song
!
a
soft
strain
of
music
sounded
,
and
then
at
the
back
of
the
cave
appeared
a
little
figure
in
cloudy
white
,
with
glittering
wings
,
golden
hair
,
and
a
garland
of
roses
on
its
head
.
waving
a
wand
,
it
sang
...
hither
i
come
,
from
my
airy
home
,
afar
in
the
silver
moon
.
take
the
magic
spell
,
and
use
it
well
,
or
its
power
will
vanish
soon
!
and
dropping
a
small
,
gilded
bottle
at
the
witch
s
feet
,
the
spirit
vanished
.
another
chant
from
hagar
produced
another
apparition
,
not
a
lovely
one
,
for
with
a
bang
an
ugly
black
imp
appeared
and
,
having
croaked
a
reply
,
tossed
a
dark
bottle
at
hugo
and
disappeared
with
a
mocking
laugh
.
having
warbled
his
thanks
and
put
the
potions
in
his
boots
,
hugo
departed
,
and
hagar
informed
the
audience
that
as
he
had
killed
a
few
of
her
friends
in
times
past
,
she
had
cursed
him
,
and
intends
to
thwart
his
plans
,
and
be
revenged
on
him
.
then
the
curtain
fell
,
and
the
audience
reposed
and
ate
candy
while
discussing
the
merits
of
the
play
.
a
good
deal
of
hammering
went
on
before
the
curtain
rose
again
,
but
when
it
became
evident
what
a
masterpiece
of
stage
carpentery
had
been
got
up
,
no
one
murmured
at
the
delay
.
it
was
truly
superb
.
a
tower
rose
to
the
ceiling
,
halfway
up
appeared
a
window
with
a
lamp
burning
in
it
,
and
behind
the
white
curtain
appeared
zara
in
a
lovely
blue
and
silver
dress
,
waiting
for
roderigo
.
he
came
in
gorgeous
array
,
with
plumed
cap
,
red
cloak
,
chestnut
lovelocks
,
a
guitar
,
and
the
boots
,
of
course
.
kneeling
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
,
he
sang
a
serenade
in
melting
tones
.
zara
replied
and
,
after
a
musical
dialogue
,
consented
to
fly
.
then
came
the
grand
effect
of
the
play
.
roderigo
produced
a
rope
ladder
,
with
five
steps
to
it
,
threw
up
one
end
,
and
invited
zara
to
descend
.
timidly
she
crept
from
her
lattice
,
put
her
hand
on
roderigo
s
shoulder
,
and
was
about
to
leap
gracefully
down
when
alas
!
alas
for
zara
!
she
forgot
her
train
.
it
caught
in
the
window
,
the
tower
tottered
,
leaned
forward
,
fell
with
a
crash
,
and
buried
the
unhappy
lovers
in
the
ruins
.
a
universal
shriek
arose
as
the
russet
boots
waved
wildly
from
the
wreck
and
a
golden
head
emerged
,
exclaiming
,
i
told
you
so
!
i
told
you
so
!
with
wonderful
presence
of
mind
,
don
pedro
,
the
cruel
sire
,
rushed
in
,
dragged
out
his
daughter
,
with
a
hasty
aside
...
don
t
laugh
!
act
as
if
it
was
all
right
!
and
,
ordering
roderigo
up
,
banished
him
from
the
kingdom
with
wrath
and
scorn
.
though
decidedly
shaken
by
the
fall
from
the
tower
upon
him
,
roderigo
defied
the
old
gentleman
and
refused
to
stir
.
this
dauntless
example
fired
zara
.
she
also
defied
her
sire
,
and
he
ordered
them
both
to
the
deepest
dungeons
of
the
castle
.
a
stout
little
retainer
came
in
with
chains
and
led
them
away
,
looking
very
much
frightened
and
evidently
forgetting
the
speech
he
ought
to
have
made
.
act
third
was
the
castle
hall
,
and
here
hagar
appeared
,
having
come
to
free
the
lovers
and
finish
hugo
.
she
hears
him
coming
and
hides
,
sees
him
put
the
potions
into
two
cups
of
wine
and
bid
the
timid
little
servant
,
bear
them
to
the
captives
in
their
cells
,
and
tell
them
i
shall
come
anon
.
the
servant
takes
hugo
aside
to
tell
him
something
,
and
hagar
changes
the
cups
for
two
others
which
are
harmless
.
ferdinando
,
the
minion
,
carries
them
away
,
and
hagar
puts
back
the
cup
which
holds
the
poison
meant
for
roderigo
.
hugo
,
getting
thirsty
after
a
long
warble
,
drinks
it
,
loses
his
wits
,
and
after
a
good
deal
of
clutching
and
stamping
,
falls
flat
and
dies
,
while
hagar
informs
him
what
she
has
done
in
a
song
of
exquisite
power
and
melody
.
this
was
a
truly
thrilling
scene
,
though
some
persons
might
have
thought
that
the
sudden
tumbling
down
of
a
quantity
of
long
red
hair
rather
marred
the
effect
of
the
villain
s
death
.
he
was
called
before
the
curtain
,
and
with
great
propriety
appeared
,
leading
hagar
,
whose
singing
was
considered
more
wonderful
than
all
the
rest
of
the
performance
put
together
.
act
fourth
displayed
the
despairing
roderigo
on
the
point
of
stabbing
himself
because
he
has
been
told
that
zara
has
deserted
him
.
just
as
the
dagger
is
at
his
heart
,
a
lovely
song
is
sung
under
his
window
,
informing
him
that
zara
is
true
but
in
danger
,
and
he
can
save
her
if
he
will
.
a
key
is
thrown
in
,
which
unlocks
the
door
,
and
in
a
spasm
of
rapture
he
tears
off
his
chains
and
rushes
away
to
find
and
rescue
his
lady
love
.
act
fifth
opened
with
a
stormy
scene
between
zara
and
don
pedro
.
he
wishes
her
to
go
into
a
convent
,
but
she
won
t
hear
of
it
,
and
after
a
touching
appeal
,
is
about
to
faint
when
roderigo
dashes
in
and
demands
her
hand
.
don
pedro
refuses
,
because
he
is
not
rich
.
they
shout
and
gesticulate
tremendously
but
cannot
agree
,
and
rodrigo
is
about
to
bear
away
the
exhausted
zara
,
when
the
timid
servant
enters
with
a
letter
and
a
bag
from
hagar
,
who
has
mysteriously
disappeared
.
the
latter
informs
the
party
that
she
bequeaths
untold
wealth
to
the
young
pair
and
an
awful
doom
to
don
pedro
,
if
he
doesn
t
make
them
happy
.
the
bag
is
opened
,
and
several
quarts
of
tin
money
shower
down
upon
the
stage
till
it
is
quite
glorified
with
the
glitter
.
this
entirely
softens
the
stern
sire
.
he
consents
without
a
murmur
,
all
join
in
a
joyful
chorus
,
and
the
curtain
falls
upon
the
lovers
kneeling
to
receive
don
pedro
s
blessing
in
attitudes
of
the
most
romantic
grace
.
tumultuous
applause
followed
but
received
an
unexpected
check
,
for
the
cot
bed
,
on
which
the
dress
circle
was
built
,
suddenly
shut
up
and
extinguished
the
enthusiastic
audience
.
roderigo
and
don
pedro
flew
to
the
rescue
,
and
all
were
taken
out
unhurt
,
though
many
were
speechless
with
laughter
.
the
excitement
had
hardly
subsided
when
hannah
appeared
,
with
mrs
.
march
s
compliments
,
and
would
the
ladies
walk
down
to
supper
.
this
was
a
surprise
even
to
the
actors
,
and
when
they
saw
the
table
,
they
looked
at
one
another
in
rapturous
amazement
.
it
was
like
marmee
to
get
up
a
little
treat
for
them
,
but
anything
so
fine
as
this
was
unheard
of
since
the
departed
days
of
plenty
.
there
was
ice
cream
,
actually
two
dishes
of
it
,
pink
and
white
,
and
cake
and
fruit
and
distracting
french
bonbons
and
,
in
the
middle
of
the
table
,
four
great
bouquets
of
hot
house
flowers
.
it
quite
took
their
breath
away
,
and
they
stared
first
at
the
table
and
then
at
their
mother
,
who
looked
as
if
she
enjoyed
it
immensely
.
is
it
fairies
?
asked
amy
.
santa
claus
,
said
beth
.
mother
did
it
.
and
meg
smiled
her
sweetest
,
in
spite
of
her
gray
beard
and
white
eyebrows
.
aunt
march
had
a
good
fit
and
sent
the
supper
,
cried
jo
,
with
a
sudden
inspiration
.
all
wrong
.
old
mr
.
laurence
sent
it
,
replied
mrs
.
march
.
the
laurence
boy
s
grandfather
!
what
in
the
world
put
such
a
thing
into
his
head
?
we
don
t
know
him
!
exclaimed
meg
.
hannah
told
one
of
his
servants
about
your
breakfast
party
.
he
is
an
odd
old
gentleman
,
but
that
pleased
him
.
he
knew
my
father
years
ago
,
and
he
sent
me
a
polite
note
this
afternoon
,
saying
he
hoped
i
would
allow
him
to
express
his
friendly
feeling
toward
my
children
by
sending
them
a
few
trifles
in
honor
of
the
day
.
i
could
not
refuse
,
and
so
you
have
a
little
feast
at
night
to
make
up
for
the
bread
and
milk
breakfast
.
that
boy
put
it
into
his
head
,
i
know
he
did
!
he
s
a
capital
fellow
,
and
i
wish
we
could
get
acquainted
.
he
looks
as
if
he
d
like
to
know
us
but
he
s
bashful
,
and
meg
is
so
prim
she
won
t
let
me
speak
to
him
when
we
pass
,
said
jo
,
as
the
plates
went
round
,
and
the
ice
began
to
melt
out
of
sight
,
with
ohs
and
ahs
of
satisfaction
.
you
mean
the
people
who
live
in
the
big
house
next
door
,
don
t
you
?
asked
one
of
the
girls
.
my
mother
knows
old
mr
.
laurence
,
but
says
he
s
very
proud
and
doesn
t
like
to
mix
with
his
neighbors
.
he
keeps
his
grandson
shut
up
,
when
he
isn
t
riding
or
walking
with
his
tutor
,
and
makes
him
study
very
hard
.
we
invited
him
to
our
party
,
but
he
didn
t
come
.
mother
says
he
s
very
nice
,
though
he
never
speaks
to
us
girls
.
our
cat
ran
away
once
,
and
he
brought
her
back
,
and
we
talked
over
the
fence
,
and
were
getting
on
capitally
,
all
about
cricket
,
and
so
on
,
when
he
saw
meg
coming
,
and
walked
off
.
i
mean
to
know
him
some
day
,
for
he
needs
fun
,
i
m
sure
he
does
,
said
jo
decidedly
.
i
like
his
manners
,
and
he
looks
like
a
little
gentleman
,
so
i
ve
no
objection
to
your
knowing
him
,
if
a
proper
opportunity
comes
.
he
brought
the
flowers
himself
,
and
i
should
have
asked
him
in
,
if
i
had
been
sure
what
was
going
on
upstairs
.
he
looked
so
wistful
as
he
went
away
,
hearing
the
frolic
and
evidently
having
none
of
his
own
.
it
s
a
mercy
you
didn
t
,
mother
!
laughed
jo
,
looking
at
her
boots
.
but
we
ll
have
another
play
sometime
that
he
can
see
.
perhaps
he
ll
help
act
.
wouldn
t
that
be
jolly
?
i
never
had
such
a
fine
bouquet
before
!
how
pretty
it
is
!
and
meg
examined
her
flowers
with
great
interest
.
they
are
lovely
.
but
beth
s
roses
are
sweeter
to
me
,
said
mrs
.
march
,
smelling
the
half
dead
posy
in
her
belt
.
beth
nestled
up
to
her
,
and
whispered
softly
,
i
wish
i
could
send
my
bunch
to
father
.
i
m
afraid
he
isn
t
having
such
a
merry
christmas
as
we
are
.
chapter
three
the
laurence
boy
jo
!
jo
!
where
are
you
?
cried
meg
at
the
foot
of
the
garret
stairs
.
here
!
answered
a
husky
voice
from
above
,
and
,
running
up
,
meg
found
her
sister
eating
apples
and
crying
over
the
heir
of
redclyffe
,
wrapped
up
in
a
comforter
on
an
old
three
legged
sofa
by
the
sunny
window
.
this
was
jo
s
favorite
refuge
,
and
here
she
loved
to
retire
with
half
a
dozen
russets
and
a
nice
book
,
to
enjoy
the
quiet
and
the
society
of
a
pet
rat
who
lived
near
by
and
didn
t
mind
her
a
particle
.
as
meg
appeared
,
scrabble
whisked
into
his
hole
.
jo
shook
the
tears
off
her
cheeks
and
waited
to
hear
the
news
.
such
fun
!
only
see
!
a
regular
note
of
invitation
from
mrs
.
gardiner
for
tomorrow
night
!
cried
meg
,
waving
the
precious
paper
and
then
proceeding
to
read
it
with
girlish
delight
.
mrs
.
gardiner
would
be
happy
to
see
miss
march
and
miss
josephine
at
a
little
dance
on
new
year
s
eve
.
marmee
is
willing
we
should
go
,
now
what
shall
we
wear
?
what
s
the
use
of
asking
that
,
when
you
know
we
shall
wear
our
poplins
,
because
we
haven
t
got
anything
else
?
answered
jo
with
her
mouth
full
.
if
i
only
had
a
silk
!
sighed
meg
.
mother
says
i
may
when
i
m
eighteen
perhaps
,
but
two
years
is
an
everlasting
time
to
wait
.
i
m
sure
our
pops
look
like
silk
,
and
they
are
nice
enough
for
us
.
yours
is
as
good
as
new
,
but
i
forgot
the
burn
and
the
tear
in
mine
.
whatever
shall
i
do
?
the
burn
shows
badly
,
and
i
can
t
take
any
out
.
you
must
sit
still
all
you
can
and
keep
your
back
out
of
sight
.
the
front
is
all
right
.
i
shall
have
a
new
ribbon
for
my
hair
,
and
marmee
will
lend
me
her
little
pearl
pin
,
and
my
new
slippers
are
lovely
,
and
my
gloves
will
do
,
though
they
aren
t
as
nice
as
i
d
like
.
mine
are
spoiled
with
lemonade
,
and
i
can
t
get
any
new
ones
,
so
i
shall
have
to
go
without
,
said
jo
,
who
never
troubled
herself
much
about
dress
.
you
must
have
gloves
,
or
i
won
t
go
,
cried
meg
decidedly
.
gloves
are
more
important
than
anything
else
.
you
can
t
dance
without
them
,
and
if
you
don
t
i
should
be
so
mortified
.
then
i
ll
stay
still
.
i
don
t
care
much
for
company
dancing
.
it
s
no
fun
to
go
sailing
round
.
i
like
to
fly
about
and
cut
capers
.
you
can
t
ask
mother
for
new
ones
,
they
are
so
expensive
,
and
you
are
so
careless
.
she
said
when
you
spoiled
the
others
that
she
shouldn
t
get
you
any
more
this
winter
.
can
t
you
make
them
do
?
i
can
hold
them
crumpled
up
in
my
hand
,
so
no
one
will
know
how
stained
they
are
.
that
s
all
i
can
do
.
no
!
i
ll
tell
you
how
we
can
manage
,
each
wear
one
good
one
and
carry
a
bad
one
.
don
t
you
see
?
your
hands
are
bigger
than
mine
,
and
you
will
stretch
my
glove
dreadfully
,
began
meg
,
whose
gloves
were
a
tender
point
with
her
.
then
i
ll
go
without
.
i
don
t
care
what
people
say
!
cried
jo
,
taking
up
her
book
.
you
may
have
it
,
you
may
!
only
don
t
stain
it
,
and
do
behave
nicely
.
don
t
put
your
hands
behind
you
,
or
stare
,
or
say
christopher
columbus
!
will
you
?
don
t
worry
about
me
.
i
ll
be
as
prim
as
i
can
and
not
get
into
any
scrapes
,
if
i
can
help
it
.
now
go
and
answer
your
note
,
and
let
me
finish
this
splendid
story
.
so
meg
went
away
to
accept
with
thanks
,
look
over
her
dress
,
and
sing
blithely
as
she
did
up
her
one
real
lace
frill
,
while
jo
finished
her
story
,
her
four
apples
,
and
had
a
game
of
romps
with
scrabble
.
on
new
year
s
eve
the
parlor
was
deserted
,
for
the
two
younger
girls
played
dressing
maids
and
the
two
elder
were
absorbed
in
the
all
important
business
of
getting
ready
for
the
party
.
simple
as
the
toilets
were
,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
running
up
and
down
,
laughing
and
talking
,
and
at
one
time
a
strong
smell
of
burned
hair
pervaded
the
house
.
meg
wanted
a
few
curls
about
her
face
,
and
jo
undertook
to
pinch
the
papered
locks
with
a
pair
of
hot
tongs
.
ought
they
to
smoke
like
that
?
asked
beth
from
her
perch
on
the
bed
.
it
s
the
dampness
drying
,
replied
jo
.
what
a
queer
smell
!
it
s
like
burned
feathers
,
observed
amy
,
smoothing
her
own
pretty
curls
with
a
superior
air
.
there
,
now
i
ll
take
off
the
papers
and
you
ll
see
a
cloud
of
little
ringlets
,
said
jo
,
putting
down
the
tongs
.
she
did
take
off
the
papers
,
but
no
cloud
of
ringlets
appeared
,
for
the
hair
came
with
the
papers
,
and
the
horrified
hairdresser
laid
a
row
of
little
scorched
bundles
on
the
bureau
before
her
victim
.
oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
what
have
you
done
?
i
m
spoiled
!
i
can
t
go
!
my
hair
,
oh
,
my
hair
!
wailed
meg
,
looking
with
despair
at
the
uneven
frizzle
on
her
forehead
.
just
my
luck
!
you
shouldn
t
have
asked
me
to
do
it
.
i
always
spoil
everything
.
i
m
so
sorry
,
but
the
tongs
were
too
hot
,
and
so
i
ve
made
a
mess
,
groaned
poor
jo
,
regarding
the
little
black
pancakes
with
tears
of
regret
.
it
isn
t
spoiled
.
just
frizzle
it
,
and
tie
your
ribbon
so
the
ends
come
on
your
forehead
a
bit
,
and
it
will
look
like
the
last
fashion
.
i
ve
seen
many
girls
do
it
so
,
said
amy
consolingly
.
serves
me
right
for
trying
to
be
fine
.
i
wish
i
d
let
my
hair
alone
,
cried
meg
petulantly
.
so
do
i
,
it
was
so
smooth
and
pretty
.
but
it
will
soon
grow
out
again
,
said
beth
,
coming
to
kiss
and
comfort
the
shorn
sheep
.
after
various
lesser
mishaps
,
meg
was
finished
at
last
,
and
by
the
united
exertions
of
the
entire
family
jo
s
hair
was
got
up
and
her
dress
on
.
they
looked
very
well
in
their
simple
suits
,
meg
s
in
silvery
drab
,
with
a
blue
velvet
snood
,
lace
frills
,
and
the
pearl
pin
.
jo
in
maroon
,
with
a
stiff
,
gentlemanly
linen
collar
,
and
a
white
chrysanthemum
or
two
for
her
only
ornament
.
each
put
on
one
nice
light
glove
,
and
carried
one
soiled
one
,
and
all
pronounced
the
effect
quite
easy
and
fine
.
meg
s
high
heeled
slippers
were
very
tight
and
hurt
her
,
though
she
would
not
own
it
,
and
jo
s
nineteen
hairpins
all
seemed
stuck
straight
into
her
head
,
which
was
not
exactly
comfortable
,
but
,
dear
me
,
let
us
be
elegant
or
die
.
have
a
good
time
,
dearies
!
said
mrs
.
march
,
as
the
sisters
went
daintily
down
the
walk
.
don
t
eat
much
supper
,
and
come
away
at
eleven
when
i
send
hannah
for
you
.
as
the
gate
clashed
behind
them
,
a
voice
cried
from
a
window
...
girls
,
girls
!
have
you
you
both
got
nice
pocket
handkerchiefs
?
yes
,
yes
,
spandy
nice
,
and
meg
has
cologne
on
hers
,
cried
jo
,
adding
with
a
laugh
as
they
went
on
,
i
do
believe
marmee
would
ask
that
if
we
were
all
running
away
from
an
earthquake
.
it
is
one
of
her
aristocratic
tastes
,
and
quite
proper
,
for
a
real
lady
is
always
known
by
neat
boots
,
gloves
,
and
handkerchief
,
replied
meg
,
who
had
a
good
many
little
aristocratic
tastes
of
her
own
.
now
don
t
forget
to
keep
the
bad
breadth
out
of
sight
,
jo
.
is
my
sash
right
?
and
does
my
hair
look
very
bad
?
said
meg
,
as
she
turned
from
the
glass
in
mrs
.
gardiner
s
dressing
room
after
a
prolonged
prink
.
i
know
i
shall
forget
.
if
you
see
me
doing
anything
wrong
,
just
remind
me
by
a
wink
,
will
you
?
returned
jo
,
giving
her
collar
a
twitch
and
her
head
a
hasty
brush
.
no
,
winking
isn
t
ladylike
.
i
ll
lift
my
eyebrows
if
any
thing
is
wrong
,
and
nod
if
you
are
all
right
.
now
hold
your
shoulder
straight
,
and
take
short
steps
,
and
don
t
shake
hands
if
you
are
introduced
to
anyone
.
it
isn
t
the
thing
.
how
do
you
learn
all
the
proper
ways
?
i
never
can
.
isn
t
that
music
gay
?
down
they
went
,
feeling
a
trifle
timid
,
for
they
seldom
went
to
parties
,
and
informal
as
this
little
gathering
was
,
it
was
an
event
to
them
.
mrs
.
gardiner
,
a
stately
old
lady
,
greeted
them
kindly
and
handed
them
over
to
the
eldest
of
her
six
daughters
.
meg
knew
sallie
and
was
at
her
ease
very
soon
,
but
jo
,
who
didn
t
care
much
for
girls
or
girlish
gossip
,
stood
about
,
with
her
back
carefully
against
the
wall
,
and
felt
as
much
out
of
place
as
a
colt
in
a
flower
garden
.
half
a
dozen
jovial
lads
were
talking
about
skates
in
another
part
of
the
room
,
and
she
longed
to
go
and
join
them
,
for
skating
was
one
of
the
joys
of
her
life
.
she
telegraphed
her
wish
to
meg
,
but
the
eyebrows
went
up
so
alarmingly
that
she
dared
not
stir
.
no
one
came
to
talk
to
her
,
and
one
by
one
the
group
dwindled
away
till
she
was
left
alone
.
she
could
not
roam
about
and
amuse
herself
,
for
the
burned
breadth
would
show
,
so
she
stared
at
people
rather
forlornly
till
the
dancing
began
.
meg
was
asked
at
once
,
and
the
tight
slippers
tripped
about
so
briskly
that
none
would
have
guessed
the
pain
their
wearer
suffered
smilingly
.
jo
saw
a
big
red
headed
youth
approaching
her
corner
,
and
fearing
he
meant
to
engage
her
,
she
slipped
into
a
curtained
recess
,
intending
to
peep
and
enjoy
herself
in
peace
.
unfortunately
,
another
bashful
person
had
chosen
the
same
refuge
,
for
,
as
the
curtain
fell
behind
her
,
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
laurence
boy
.
dear
me
,
i
didn
t
know
anyone
was
here
!
stammered
jo
,
preparing
to
back
out
as
speedily
as
she
had
bounced
in
.
but
the
boy
laughed
and
said
pleasantly
,
though
he
looked
a
little
startled
,
don
t
mind
me
,
stay
if
you
like
.
shan
t
i
disturb
you
?
not
a
bit
.
i
only
came
here
because
i
don
t
know
many
people
and
felt
rather
strange
at
first
,
you
know
.
so
did
i
.
don
t
go
away
,
please
,
unless
you
d
rather
.
the
boy
sat
down
again
and
looked
at
his
pumps
,
till
jo
said
,
trying
to
be
polite
and
easy
,
i
think
i
ve
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
.
you
live
near
us
,
don
t
you
?
next
door
.
and
he
looked
up
and
laughed
outright
,
for
jo
s
prim
manner
was
rather
funny
when
he
remembered
how
they
had
chatted
about
cricket
when
he
brought
the
cat
home
.
that
put
jo
at
her
ease
and
she
laughed
too
,
as
she
said
,
in
her
heartiest
way
,
we
did
have
such
a
good
time
over
your
nice
christmas
present
.
grandpa
sent
it
.
but
you
put
it
into
his
head
,
didn
t
you
,
now
?
how
is
your
cat
,
miss
march
?
asked
the
boy
,
trying
to
look
sober
while
his
black
eyes
shone
with
fun
.
nicely
,
thank
you
,
mr
.
laurence
.
but
i
am
not
miss
march
,
i
m
only
jo
,
returned
the
young
lady
.
i
m
not
mr
.
laurence
,
i
m
only
laurie
.
laurie
laurence
,
what
an
odd
name
.
my
first
name
is
theodore
,
but
i
don
t
like
it
,
for
the
fellows
called
me
dora
,
so
i
made
them
say
laurie
instead
.
i
hate
my
name
,
too
,
so
sentimental
!
i
wish
every
one
would
say
jo
instead
of
josephine
.
how
did
you
make
the
boys
stop
calling
you
dora
?
i
thrashed
em
.
i
can
t
thrash
aunt
march
,
so
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
bear
it
.
and
jo
resigned
herself
with
a
sigh
.
don
t
you
like
to
dance
,
miss
jo
?
asked
laurie
,
looking
as
if
he
thought
the
name
suited
her
.
i
like
it
well
enough
if
there
is
plenty
of
room
,
and
everyone
is
lively
.
in
a
place
like
this
i
m
sure
to
upset
something
,
tread
on
people
s
toes
,
or
do
something
dreadful
,
so
i
keep
out
of
mischief
and
let
meg
sail
about
.
don
t
you
dance
?
sometimes
.
you
see
i
ve
been
abroad
a
good
many
years
,
and
haven
t
been
into
company
enough
yet
to
know
how
you
do
things
here
.
abroad
!
cried
jo
.
oh
,
tell
me
about
it
!
i
love
dearly
to
hear
people
describe
their
travels
.
laurie
didn
t
seem
to
know
where
to
begin
,
but
jo
s
eager
questions
soon
set
him
going
,
and
he
told
her
how
he
had
been
at
school
in
vevay
,
where
the
boys
never
wore
hats
and
had
a
fleet
of
boats
on
the
lake
,
and
for
holiday
fun
went
on
walking
trips
about
switzerland
with
their
teachers
.
don
t
i
wish
i
d
been
there
!
cried
jo
.
did
you
go
to
paris
?
we
spent
last
winter
there
.
can
you
talk
french
?
we
were
not
allowed
to
speak
anything
else
at
vevay
.
do
say
some
!
i
can
read
it
,
but
can
t
pronounce
.
quel
nom
a
cette
jeune
demoiselle
en
les
pantoufles
jolis
?
how
nicely
you
do
it
!
let
me
see
...
you
said
,
who
is
the
young
lady
in
the
pretty
slippers
,
didn
t
you
?
oui
,
mademoiselle
.
it
s
my
sister
margaret
,
and
you
knew
it
was
!
do
you
think
she
is
pretty
?
yes
,
she
makes
me
think
of
the
german
girls
,
she
looks
so
fresh
and
quiet
,
and
dances
like
a
lady
.
jo
quite
glowed
with
pleasure
at
this
boyish
praise
of
her
sister
,
and
stored
it
up
to
repeat
to
meg
.
both
peeped
and
criticized
and
chatted
till
they
felt
like
old
acquaintances
.
laurie
s
bashfulness
soon
wore
off
,
for
jo
s
gentlemanly
demeanor
amused
and
set
him
at
his
ease
,
and
jo
was
her
merry
self
again
,
because
her
dress
was
forgotten
and
nobody
lifted
their
eyebrows
at
her
.
she
liked
the
laurence
boy
better
than
ever
and
took
several
good
looks
at
him
,
so
that
she
might
describe
him
to
the
girls
,
for
they
had
no
brothers
,
very
few
male
cousins
,
and
boys
were
almost
unknown
creatures
to
them
.
curly
black
hair
,
brown
skin
,
big
black
eyes
,
handsome
nose
,
fine
teeth
,
small
hands
and
feet
,
taller
than
i
am
,
very
polite
,
for
a
boy
,
and
altogether
jolly
.
wonder
how
old
he
is
?
it
was
on
the
tip
of
jo
s
tongue
to
ask
,
but
she
checked
herself
in
time
and
,
with
unusual
tact
,
tried
to
find
out
in
a
round
about
way
.
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
college
soon
?
i
see
you
pegging
away
at
your
books
,
no
,
i
mean
studying
hard
.
and
jo
blushed
at
the
dreadful
pegging
which
had
escaped
her
.
laurie
smiled
but
didn
t
seem
shocked
,
and
answered
with
a
shrug
.
not
for
a
year
or
two
.
i
won
t
go
before
seventeen
,
anyway
.
aren
t
you
but
fifteen
?
asked
jo
,
looking
at
the
tall
lad
,
whom
she
had
imagined
seventeen
already
.
sixteen
,
next
month
.
how
i
wish
i
was
going
to
college
!
you
don
t
look
as
if
you
liked
it
.
i
hate
it
!
nothing
but
grinding
or
skylarking
.
and
i
don
t
like
the
way
fellows
do
either
,
in
this
country
.
what
do
you
like
?
to
live
in
italy
,
and
to
enjoy
myself
in
my
own
way
.
jo
wanted
very
much
to
ask
what
his
own
way
was
,
but
his
black
brows
looked
rather
threatening
as
he
knit
them
,
so
she
changed
the
subject
by
saying
,
as
her
foot
kept
time
,
that
s
a
splendid
polka
!
why
don
t
you
go
and
try
it
?
if
you
will
come
too
,
he
answered
,
with
a
gallant
little
bow
.
i
can
t
,
for
i
told
meg
i
wouldn
t
,
because
...
there
jo
stopped
,
and
looked
undecided
whether
to
tell
or
to
laugh
.
because
,
what
?
you
won
t
tell
?
never
!
well
,
i
have
a
bad
trick
of
standing
before
the
fire
,
and
so
i
burn
my
frocks
,
and
i
scorched
this
one
,
and
though
it
s
nicely
mended
,
it
shows
,
and
meg
told
me
to
keep
still
so
no
one
would
see
it
.
you
may
laugh
,
if
you
want
to
.
it
is
funny
,
i
know
.
but
laurie
didn
t
laugh
.
he
only
looked
down
a
minute
,
and
the
expression
of
his
face
puzzled
jo
when
he
said
very
gently
,
never
mind
that
.
i
ll
tell
you
how
we
can
manage
.
there
s
a
long
hall
out
there
,
and
we
can
dance
grandly
,
and
no
one
will
see
us
.
please
come
.
jo
thanked
him
and
gladly
went
,
wishing
she
had
two
neat
gloves
when
she
saw
the
nice
,
pearl
colored
ones
her
partner
wore
.
the
hall
was
empty
,
and
they
had
a
grand
polka
,
for
laurie
danced
well
,
and
taught
her
the
german
step
,
which
delighted
jo
,
being
full
of
swing
and
spring
.
when
the
music
stopped
,
they
sat
down
on
the
stairs
to
get
their
breath
,
and
laurie
was
in
the
midst
of
an
account
of
a
students
festival
at
heidelberg
when
meg
appeared
in
search
of
her
sister
.
she
beckoned
,
and
jo
reluctantly
followed
her
into
a
side
room
,
where
she
found
her
on
a
sofa
,
holding
her
foot
,
and
looking
pale
.
i
ve
sprained
my
ankle
.
that
stupid
high
heel
turned
and
gave
me
a
sad
wrench
.
it
aches
so
,
i
can
hardly
stand
,
and
i
don
t
know
how
i
m
ever
going
to
get
home
,
she
said
,
rocking
to
and
fro
in
pain
.
i
knew
you
d
hurt
your
feet
with
those
silly
shoes
.
i
m
sorry
.
but
i
don
t
see
what
you
can
do
,
except
get
a
carriage
,
or
stay
here
all
night
,
answered
jo
,
softly
rubbing
the
poor
ankle
as
she
spoke
.
i
can
t
have
a
carriage
without
its
costing
ever
so
much
.
i
dare
say
i
can
t
get
one
at
all
,
for
most
people
come
in
their
own
,
and
it
s
a
long
way
to
the
stable
,
and
no
one
to
send
.
i
ll
go
.
no
,
indeed
!
it
s
past
nine
,
and
dark
as
egypt
.
i
can
t
stop
here
,
for
the
house
is
full
.
sallie
has
some
girls
staying
with
her
.
i
ll
rest
till
hannah
comes
,
and
then
do
the
best
i
can
.
i
ll
ask
laurie
.
he
will
go
,
said
jo
,
looking
relieved
as
the
idea
occurred
to
her
.
mercy
,
no
!
don
t
ask
or
tell
anyone
.
get
me
my
rubbers
,
and
put
these
slippers
with
our
things
.
i
can
t
dance
anymore
,
but
as
soon
as
supper
is
over
,
watch
for
hannah
and
tell
me
the
minute
she
comes
.
they
are
going
out
to
supper
now
.
i
ll
stay
with
you
.
i
d
rather
.
no
,
dear
,
run
along
,
and
bring
me
some
coffee
.
i
m
so
tired
i
can
t
stir
.
so
meg
reclined
,
with
rubbers
well
hidden
,
and
jo
went
blundering
away
to
the
dining
room
,
which
she
found
after
going
into
a
china
closet
,
and
opening
the
door
of
a
room
where
old
mr
.
gardiner
was
taking
a
little
private
refreshment
.
making
a
dart
at
the
table
,
she
secured
the
coffee
,
which
she
immediately
spilled
,
thereby
making
the
front
of
her
dress
as
bad
as
the
back
.
oh
,
dear
,
what
a
blunderbuss
i
am
!
exclaimed
jo
,
finishing
meg
s
glove
by
scrubbing
her
gown
with
it
.
can
i
help
you
?
said
a
friendly
voice
.
and
there
was
laurie
,
with
a
full
cup
in
one
hand
and
a
plate
of
ice
in
the
other
.
i
was
trying
to
get
something
for
meg
,
who
is
very
tired
,
and
someone
shook
me
,
and
here
i
am
in
a
nice
state
,
answered
jo
,
glancing
dismally
from
the
stained
skirt
to
the
coffee
colored
glove
.
too
bad
!
i
was
looking
for
someone
to
give
this
to
.
may
i
take
it
to
your
sister
?
oh
,
thank
you
!
i
ll
show
you
where
she
is
.
i
don
t
offer
to
take
it
myself
,
for
i
should
only
get
into
another
scrape
if
i
did
.
jo
led
the
way
,
and
as
if
used
to
waiting
on
ladies
,
laurie
drew
up
a
little
table
,
brought
a
second
installment
of
coffee
and
ice
for
jo
,
and
was
so
obliging
that
even
particular
meg
pronounced
him
a
nice
boy
.
they
had
a
merry
time
over
the
bonbons
and
mottoes
,
and
were
in
the
midst
of
a
quiet
game
of
buzz
,
with
two
or
three
other
young
people
who
had
strayed
in
,
when
hannah
appeared
.
meg
forgot
her
foot
and
rose
so
quickly
that
she
was
forced
to
catch
hold
of
jo
,
with
an
exclamation
of
pain
.
hush
!
don
t
say
anything
,
she
whispered
,
adding
aloud
,
it
s
nothing
.
i
turned
my
foot
a
little
,
that
s
all
,
and
limped
upstairs
to
put
her
things
on
.
hannah
scolded
,
meg
cried
,
and
jo
was
at
her
wits
end
,
till
she
decided
to
take
things
into
her
own
hands
.
slipping
out
,
she
ran
down
and
,
finding
a
servant
,
asked
if
he
could
get
her
a
carriage
.
it
happened
to
be
a
hired
waiter
who
knew
nothing
about
the
neighborhood
and
jo
was
looking
round
for
help
when
laurie
,
who
had
heard
what
she
said
,
came
up
and
offered
his
grandfather
s
carriage
,
which
had
just
come
for
him
,
he
said
.
it
s
so
early
!
you
can
t
mean
to
go
yet
?
began
jo
,
looking
relieved
but
hesitating
to
accept
the
offer
.
i
always
go
early
,
i
do
,
truly
!
please
let
me
take
you
home
.
it
s
all
on
my
way
,
you
know
,
and
it
rains
,
they
say
.
that
settled
it
,
and
telling
him
of
meg
s
mishap
,
jo
gratefully
accepted
and
rushed
up
to
bring
down
the
rest
of
the
party
.
hannah
hated
rain
as
much
as
a
cat
does
so
she
made
no
trouble
,
and
they
rolled
away
in
the
luxurious
close
carriage
,
feeling
very
festive
and
elegant
.
laurie
went
on
the
box
so
meg
could
keep
her
foot
up
,
and
the
girls
talked
over
their
party
in
freedom
.
i
had
a
capital
time
.
did
you
?
asked
jo
,
rumpling
up
her
hair
,
and
making
herself
comfortable
.
yes
,
till
i
hurt
myself
.
sallie
s
friend
,
annie
moffat
,
took
a
fancy
to
me
,
and
asked
me
to
come
and
spend
a
week
with
her
when
sallie
does
.
she
is
going
in
the
spring
when
the
opera
comes
,
and
it
will
be
perfectly
splendid
,
if
mother
only
lets
me
go
,
answered
meg
,
cheering
up
at
the
thought
.
i
saw
you
dancing
with
the
red
headed
man
i
ran
away
from
.
was
he
nice
?
oh
,
very
!
his
hair
is
auburn
,
not
red
,
and
he
was
very
polite
,
and
i
had
a
delicious
redowa
with
him
.
he
looked
like
a
grasshopper
in
a
fit
when
he
did
the
new
step
.
laurie
and
i
couldn
t
help
laughing
.
did
you
hear
us
?
no
,
but
it
was
very
rude
.
what
were
you
about
all
that
time
,
hidden
away
there
?
jo
told
her
adventures
,
and
by
the
time
she
had
finished
they
were
at
home
.
with
many
thanks
,
they
said
good
night
and
crept
in
,
hoping
to
disturb
no
one
,
but
the
instant
their
door
creaked
,
two
little
nightcaps
bobbed
up
,
and
two
sleepy
but
eager
voices
cried
out
...
tell
about
the
party
!
tell
about
the
party
!
with
what
meg
called
a
great
want
of
manners
jo
had
saved
some
bonbons
for
the
little
girls
,
and
they
soon
subsided
,
after
hearing
the
most
thrilling
events
of
the
evening
.
i
declare
,
it
really
seems
like
being
a
fine
young
lady
,
to
come
home
from
the
party
in
a
carriage
and
sit
in
my
dressing
gown
with
a
maid
to
wait
on
me
,
said
meg
,
as
jo
bound
up
her
foot
with
arnica
and
brushed
her
hair
.
i
don
t
believe
fine
young
ladies
enjoy
themselves
a
bit
more
than
we
do
,
in
spite
of
our
burned
hair
,
old
gowns
,
one
glove
apiece
and
tight
slippers
that
sprain
our
ankles
when
we
are
silly
enough
to
wear
them
.
and
i
think
jo
was
quite
right
.
chapter
four
burdens
oh
,
dear
,
how
hard
it
does
seem
to
take
up
our
packs
and
go
on
,
sighed
meg
the
morning
after
the
party
,
for
now
the
holidays
were
over
,
the
week
of
merrymaking
did
not
fit
her
for
going
on
easily
with
the
task
she
never
liked
.
i
wish
it
was
christmas
or
new
year
s
all
the
time
.
wouldn
t
it
be
fun
?
answered
jo
,
yawning
dismally
.
we
shouldn
t
enjoy
ourselves
half
so
much
as
we
do
now
.
but
it
does
seem
so
nice
to
have
little
suppers
and
bouquets
,
and
go
to
parties
,
and
drive
home
,
and
read
and
rest
,
and
not
work
.
it
s
like
other
people
,
you
know
,
and
i
always
envy
girls
who
do
such
things
,
i
m
so
fond
of
luxury
,
said
meg
,
trying
to
decide
which
of
two
shabby
gowns
was
the
least
shabby
.
well
,
we
can
t
have
it
,
so
don
t
let
us
grumble
but
shoulder
our
bundles
and
trudge
along
as
cheerfully
as
marmee
does
.
i
m
sure
aunt
march
is
a
regular
old
man
of
the
sea
to
me
,
but
i
suppose
when
i
ve
learned
to
carry
her
without
complaining
,
she
will
tumble
off
,
or
get
so
light
that
i
shan
t
mind
her
.
this
idea
tickled
jo
s
fancy
and
put
her
in
good
spirits
,
but
meg
didn
t
brighten
,
for
her
burden
,
consisting
of
four
spoiled
children
,
seemed
heavier
than
ever
.
she
had
not
heart
enough
even
to
make
herself
pretty
as
usual
by
putting
on
a
blue
neck
ribbon
and
dressing
her
hair
in
the
most
becoming
way
.
where
s
the
use
of
looking
nice
,
when
no
one
sees
me
but
those
cross
midgets
,
and
no
one
cares
whether
i
m
pretty
or
not
?
she
muttered
,
shutting
her
drawer
with
a
jerk
.
i
shall
have
to
toil
and
moil
all
my
days
,
with
only
little
bits
of
fun
now
and
then
,
and
get
old
and
ugly
and
sour
,
because
i
m
poor
and
can
t
enjoy
my
life
as
other
girls
do
.
it
s
a
shame
!
so
meg
went
down
,
wearing
an
injured
look
,
and
wasn
t
at
all
agreeable
at
breakfast
time
.
everyone
seemed
rather
out
of
sorts
and
inclined
to
croak
.
beth
had
a
headache
and
lay
on
the
sofa
,
trying
to
comfort
herself
with
the
cat
and
three
kittens
.
amy
was
fretting
because
her
lessons
were
not
learned
,
and
she
couldn
t
find
her
rubbers
.
jo
would
whistle
and
make
a
great
racket
getting
ready
.
mrs
.
march
was
very
busy
trying
to
finish
a
letter
,
which
must
go
at
once
,
and
hannah
had
the
grumps
,
for
being
up
late
didn
t
suit
her
.
there
never
was
such
a
cross
family
!
cried
jo
,
losing
her
temper
when
she
had
upset
an
inkstand
,
broken
both
boot
lacings
,
and
sat
down
upon
her
hat
.
you
re
the
crossest
person
in
it
!
returned
amy
,
washing
out
the
sum
that
was
all
wrong
with
the
tears
that
had
fallen
on
her
slate
.
beth
,
if
you
don
t
keep
these
horrid
cats
down
cellar
i
ll
have
them
drowned
,
exclaimed
meg
angrily
as
she
tried
to
get
rid
of
the
kitten
which
had
scrambled
up
her
back
and
stuck
like
a
burr
just
out
of
reach
.
jo
laughed
,
meg
scolded
,
beth
implored
,
and
amy
wailed
because
she
couldn
t
remember
how
much
nine
times
twelve
was
.
girls
,
girls
,
do
be
quiet
one
minute
!
i
must
get
this
off
by
the
early
mail
,
and
you
drive
me
distracted
with
your
worry
,
cried
mrs
.
march
,
crossing
out
the
third
spoiled
sentence
in
her
letter
.
there
was
a
momentary
lull
,
broken
by
hannah
,
who
stalked
in
,
laid
two
hot
turnovers
on
the
table
,
and
stalked
out
again
.
these
turnovers
were
an
institution
,
and
the
girls
called
them
muffs
,
for
they
had
no
others
and
found
the
hot
pies
very
comforting
to
their
hands
on
cold
mornings
.
hannah
never
forgot
to
make
them
,
no
matter
how
busy
or
grumpy
she
might
be
,
for
the
walk
was
long
and
bleak
.
the
poor
things
got
no
other
lunch
and
were
seldom
home
before
two
.
cuddle
your
cats
and
get
over
your
headache
,
bethy
.
goodbye
,
marmee
.
we
are
a
set
of
rascals
this
morning
,
but
we
ll
come
home
regular
angels
.
now
then
,
meg
!
and
jo
tramped
away
,
feeling
that
the
pilgrims
were
not
setting
out
as
they
ought
to
do
.
they
always
looked
back
before
turning
the
corner
,
for
their
mother
was
always
at
the
window
to
nod
and
smile
,
and
wave
her
hand
to
them
.
somehow
it
seemed
as
if
they
couldn
t
have
got
through
the
day
without
that
,
for
whatever
their
mood
might
be
,
the
last
glimpse
of
that
motherly
face
was
sure
to
affect
them
like
sunshine
.
if
marmee
shook
her
fist
instead
of
kissing
her
hand
to
us
,
it
would
serve
us
right
,
for
more
ungrateful
wretches
than
we
are
were
never
seen
,
cried
jo
,
taking
a
remorseful
satisfaction
in
the
snowy
walk
and
bitter
wind
.
don
t
use
such
dreadful
expressions
,
replied
meg
from
the
depths
of
the
veil
in
which
she
had
shrouded
herself
like
a
nun
sick
of
the
world
.
i
like
good
strong
words
that
mean
something
,
replied
jo
,
catching
her
hat
as
it
took
a
leap
off
her
head
preparatory
to
flying
away
altogether
.
call
yourself
any
names
you
like
,
but
i
am
neither
a
rascal
nor
a
wretch
and
i
don
t
choose
to
be
called
so
.
you
re
a
blighted
being
,
and
decidedly
cross
today
because
you
can
t
sit
in
the
lap
of
luxury
all
the
time
.
poor
dear
,
just
wait
till
i
make
my
fortune
,
and
you
shall
revel
in
carriages
and
ice
cream
and
high
heeled
slippers
,
and
posies
,
and
red
headed
boys
to
dance
with
.
how
ridiculous
you
are
,
jo
!
but
meg
laughed
at
the
nonsense
and
felt
better
in
spite
of
herself
.
lucky
for
you
i
am
,
for
if
i
put
on
crushed
airs
and
tried
to
be
dismal
,
as
you
do
,
we
should
be
in
a
nice
state
.
thank
goodness
,
i
can
always
find
something
funny
to
keep
me
up
.
don
t
croak
any
more
,
but
come
home
jolly
,
there
s
a
dear
.
jo
gave
her
sister
an
encouraging
pat
on
the
shoulder
as
they
parted
for
the
day
,
each
going
a
different
way
,
each
hugging
her
little
warm
turnover
,
and
each
trying
to
be
cheerful
in
spite
of
wintry
weather
,
hard
work
,
and
the
unsatisfied
desires
of
pleasure
loving
youth
.
when
mr
.
march
lost
his
property
in
trying
to
help
an
unfortunate
friend
,
the
two
oldest
girls
begged
to
be
allowed
to
do
something
toward
their
own
support
,
at
least
.
believing
that
they
could
not
begin
too
early
to
cultivate
energy
,
industry
,
and
independence
,
their
parents
consented
,
and
both
fell
to
work
with
the
hearty
good
will
which
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
is
sure
to
succeed
at
last
.
margaret
found
a
place
as
nursery
governess
and
felt
rich
with
her
small
salary
.
as
she
said
,
she
was
fond
of
luxury
,
and
her
chief
trouble
was
poverty
.
she
found
it
harder
to
bear
than
the
others
because
she
could
remember
a
time
when
home
was
beautiful
,
life
full
of
ease
and
pleasure
,
and
want
of
any
kind
unknown
.
she
tried
not
to
be
envious
or
discontented
,
but
it
was
very
natural
that
the
young
girl
should
long
for
pretty
things
,
gay
friends
,
accomplishments
,
and
a
happy
life
.
at
the
kings
she
daily
saw
all
she
wanted
,
for
the
children
s
older
sisters
were
just
out
,
and
meg
caught
frequent
glimpses
of
dainty
ball
dresses
and
bouquets
,
heard
lively
gossip
about
theaters
,
concerts
,
sleighing
parties
,
and
merrymakings
of
all
kinds
,
and
saw
money
lavished
on
trifles
which
would
have
been
so
precious
to
her
.
poor
meg
seldom
complained
,
but
a
sense
of
injustice
made
her
feel
bitter
toward
everyone
sometimes
,
for
she
had
not
yet
learned
to
know
how
rich
she
was
in
the
blessings
which
alone
can
make
life
happy
.
jo
happened
to
suit
aunt
march
,
who
was
lame
and
needed
an
active
person
to
wait
upon
her
.
the
childless
old
lady
had
offered
to
adopt
one
of
the
girls
when
the
troubles
came
,
and
was
much
offended
because
her
offer
was
declined
.
other
friends
told
the
marches
that
they
had
lost
all
chance
of
being
remembered
in
the
rich
old
lady
s
will
,
but
the
unworldly
marches
only
said
...
we
can
t
give
up
our
girls
for
a
dozen
fortunes
.
rich
or
poor
,
we
will
keep
together
and
be
happy
in
one
another
.
the
old
lady
wouldn
t
speak
to
them
for
a
time
,
but
happening
to
meet
jo
at
a
friend
s
,
something
in
her
comical
face
and
blunt
manners
struck
the
old
lady
s
fancy
,
and
she
proposed
to
take
her
for
a
companion
.
this
did
not
suit
jo
at
all
,
but
she
accepted
the
place
since
nothing
better
appeared
and
,
to
every
one
s
surprise
,
got
on
remarkably
well
with
her
irascible
relative
.
there
was
an
occasional
tempest
,
and
once
jo
marched
home
,
declaring
she
couldn
t
bear
it
longer
,
but
aunt
march
always
cleared
up
quickly
,
and
sent
for
her
to
come
back
again
with
such
urgency
that
she
could
not
refuse
,
for
in
her
heart
she
rather
liked
the
peppery
old
lady
.
i
suspect
that
the
real
attraction
was
a
large
library
of
fine
books
,
which
was
left
to
dust
and
spiders
since
uncle
march
died
.
jo
remembered
the
kind
old
gentleman
,
who
used
to
let
her
build
railroads
and
bridges
with
his
big
dictionaries
,
tell
her
stories
about
queer
pictures
in
his
latin
books
,
and
buy
her
cards
of
gingerbread
whenever
he
met
her
in
the
street
.
the
dim
,
dusty
room
,
with
the
busts
staring
down
from
the
tall
bookcases
,
the
cozy
chairs
,
the
globes
,
and
best
of
all
,
the
wilderness
of
books
in
which
she
could
wander
where
she
liked
,
made
the
library
a
region
of
bliss
to
her
.
the
moment
aunt
march
took
her
nap
,
or
was
busy
with
company
,
jo
hurried
to
this
quiet
place
,
and
curling
herself
up
in
the
easy
chair
,
devoured
poetry
,
romance
,
history
,
travels
,
and
pictures
like
a
regular
bookworm
.
but
,
like
all
happiness
,
it
did
not
last
long
,
for
as
sure
as
she
had
just
reached
the
heart
of
the
story
,
the
sweetest
verse
of
a
song
,
or
the
most
perilous
adventure
of
her
traveler
,
a
shrill
voice
called
,
josy
phine
!
josy
phine
!
and
she
had
to
leave
her
paradise
to
wind
yarn
,
wash
the
poodle
,
or
read
belsham
s
essays
by
the
hour
together
.
jo
s
ambition
was
to
do
something
very
splendid
.
what
it
was
,
she
had
no
idea
as
yet
,
but
left
it
for
time
to
tell
her
,
and
meanwhile
,
found
her
greatest
affliction
in
the
fact
that
she
couldn
t
read
,
run
,
and
ride
as
much
as
she
liked
.
a
quick
temper
,
sharp
tongue
,
and
restless
spirit
were
always
getting
her
into
scrapes
,
and
her
life
was
a
series
of
ups
and
downs
,
which
were
both
comic
and
pathetic
.
but
the
training
she
received
at
aunt
march
s
was
just
what
she
needed
,
and
the
thought
that
she
was
doing
something
to
support
herself
made
her
happy
in
spite
of
the
perpetual
josy
phine
!
beth
was
too
bashful
to
go
to
school
.
it
had
been
tried
,
but
she
suffered
so
much
that
it
was
given
up
,
and
she
did
her
lessons
at
home
with
her
father
.
even
when
he
went
away
,
and
her
mother
was
called
to
devote
her
skill
and
energy
to
soldiers
aid
societies
,
beth
went
faithfully
on
by
herself
and
did
the
best
she
could
.
she
was
a
housewifely
little
creature
,
and
helped
hannah
keep
home
neat
and
comfortable
for
the
workers
,
never
thinking
of
any
reward
but
to
be
loved
.
long
,
quiet
days
she
spent
,
not
lonely
nor
idle
,
for
her
little
world
was
peopled
with
imaginary
friends
,
and
she
was
by
nature
a
busy
bee
.
there
were
six
dolls
to
be
taken
up
and
dressed
every
morning
,
for
beth
was
a
child
still
and
loved
her
pets
as
well
as
ever
.
not
one
whole
or
handsome
one
among
them
,
all
were
outcasts
till
beth
took
them
in
,
for
when
her
sisters
outgrew
these
idols
,
they
passed
to
her
because
amy
would
have
nothing
old
or
ugly
.
beth
cherished
them
all
the
more
tenderly
for
that
very
reason
,
and
set
up
a
hospital
for
infirm
dolls
.
no
pins
were
ever
stuck
into
their
cotton
vitals
,
no
harsh
words
or
blows
were
ever
given
them
,
no
neglect
ever
saddened
the
heart
of
the
most
repulsive
,
but
all
were
fed
and
clothed
,
nursed
and
caressed
with
an
affection
which
never
failed
.
one
forlorn
fragment
of
dollanity
had
belonged
to
jo
and
,
having
led
a
tempestuous
life
,
was
left
a
wreck
in
the
rag
bag
,
from
which
dreary
poorhouse
it
was
rescued
by
beth
and
taken
to
her
refuge
.
having
no
top
to
its
head
,
she
tied
on
a
neat
little
cap
,
and
as
both
arms
and
legs
were
gone
,
she
hid
these
deficiencies
by
folding
it
in
a
blanket
and
devoting
her
best
bed
to
this
chronic
invalid
.
if
anyone
had
known
the
care
lavished
on
that
dolly
,
i
think
it
would
have
touched
their
hearts
,
even
while
they
laughed
.
she
brought
it
bits
of
bouquets
,
she
read
to
it
,
took
it
out
to
breathe
fresh
air
,
hidden
under
her
coat
,
she
sang
it
lullabies
and
never
went
to
bed
without
kissing
its
dirty
face
and
whispering
tenderly
,
i
hope
you
ll
have
a
good
night
,
my
poor
dear
.
beth
had
her
troubles
as
well
as
the
others
,
and
not
being
an
angel
but
a
very
human
little
girl
,
she
often
wept
a
little
weep
as
jo
said
,
because
she
couldn
t
take
music
lessons
and
have
a
fine
piano
.
she
loved
music
so
dearly
,
tried
so
hard
to
learn
,
and
practiced
away
so
patiently
at
the
jingling
old
instrument
,
that
it
did
seem
as
if
someone
not
to
hint
aunt
march
ought
to
help
her
.
nobody
did
,
however
,
and
nobody
saw
beth
wipe
the
tears
off
the
yellow
keys
,
that
wouldn
t
keep
in
tune
,
when
she
was
all
alone
.
she
sang
like
a
little
lark
about
her
work
,
never
was
too
tired
for
marmee
and
the
girls
,
and
day
after
day
said
hopefully
to
herself
,
i
know
i
ll
get
my
music
some
time
,
if
i
m
good
.
there
are
many
beths
in
the
world
,
shy
and
quiet
,
sitting
in
corners
till
needed
,
and
living
for
others
so
cheerfully
that
no
one
sees
the
sacrifices
till
the
little
cricket
on
the
hearth
stops
chirping
,
and
the
sweet
,
sunshiny
presence
vanishes
,
leaving
silence
and
shadow
behind
.
if
anybody
had
asked
amy
what
the
greatest
trial
of
her
life
was
,
she
would
have
answered
at
once
,
my
nose
.
when
she
was
a
baby
,
jo
had
accidently
dropped
her
into
the
coal
hod
,
and
amy
insisted
that
the
fall
had
ruined
her
nose
forever
.
it
was
not
big
nor
red
,
like
poor
petrea
s
,
it
was
only
rather
flat
,
and
all
the
pinching
in
the
world
could
not
give
it
an
aristocratic
point
.
no
one
minded
it
but
herself
,
and
it
was
doing
its
best
to
grow
,
but
amy
felt
deeply
the
want
of
a
grecian
nose
,
and
drew
whole
sheets
of
handsome
ones
to
console
herself
.
little
raphael
,
as
her
sisters
called
her
,
had
a
decided
talent
for
drawing
,
and
was
never
so
happy
as
when
copying
flowers
,
designing
fairies
,
or
illustrating
stories
with
queer
specimens
of
art
.
her
teachers
complained
that
instead
of
doing
her
sums
she
covered
her
slate
with
animals
,
the
blank
pages
of
her
atlas
were
used
to
copy
maps
on
,
and
caricatures
of
the
most
ludicrous
description
came
fluttering
out
of
all
her
books
at
unlucky
moments
.
she
got
through
her
lessons
as
well
as
she
could
,
and
managed
to
escape
reprimands
by
being
a
model
of
deportment
.
she
was
a
great
favorite
with
her
mates
,
being
good
tempered
and
possessing
the
happy
art
of
pleasing
without
effort
.
her
little
airs
and
graces
were
much
admired
,
so
were
her
accomplishments
,
for
besides
her
drawing
,
she
could
play
twelve
tunes
,
crochet
,
and
read
french
without
mispronouncing
more
than
two
thirds
of
the
words
.
she
had
a
plaintive
way
of
saying
,
when
papa
was
rich
we
did
so
and
so
,
which
was
very
touching
,
and
her
long
words
were
considered
perfectly
elegant
by
the
girls
.
amy
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
spoiled
,
for
everyone
petted
her
,
and
her
small
vanities
and
selfishnesses
were
growing
nicely
.
one
thing
,
however
,
rather
quenched
the
vanities
.
she
had
to
wear
her
cousin
s
clothes
.
now
florence
s
mama
hadn
t
a
particle
of
taste
,
and
amy
suffered
deeply
at
having
to
wear
a
red
instead
of
a
blue
bonnet
,
unbecoming
gowns
,
and
fussy
aprons
that
did
not
fit
.
everything
was
good
,
well
made
,
and
little
worn
,
but
amy
s
artistic
eyes
were
much
afflicted
,
especially
this
winter
,
when
her
school
dress
was
a
dull
purple
with
yellow
dots
and
no
trimming
.
my
only
comfort
,
she
said
to
meg
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
is
that
mother
doesn
t
take
tucks
in
my
dresses
whenever
i
m
naughty
,
as
maria
parks
s
mother
does
.
my
dear
,
it
s
really
dreadful
,
for
sometimes
she
is
so
bad
her
frock
is
up
to
her
knees
,
and
she
can
t
come
to
school
.
when
i
think
of
this
deggerredation
,
i
feel
that
i
can
bear
even
my
flat
nose
and
purple
gown
with
yellow
sky
rockets
on
it
.
meg
was
amy
s
confidant
and
monitor
,
and
by
some
strange
attraction
of
opposites
jo
was
gentle
beth
s
.
to
jo
alone
did
the
shy
child
tell
her
thoughts
,
and
over
her
big
harum
scarum
sister
beth
unconsciously
exercised
more
influence
than
anyone
in
the
family
.
the
two
older
girls
were
a
great
deal
to
one
another
,
but
each
took
one
of
the
younger
sisters
into
her
keeping
and
watched
over
her
in
her
own
way
,
playing
mother
they
called
it
,
and
put
their
sisters
in
the
places
of
discarded
dolls
with
the
maternal
instinct
of
little
women
.
has
anybody
got
anything
to
tell
?
it
s
been
such
a
dismal
day
i
m
really
dying
for
some
amusement
,
said
meg
,
as
they
sat
sewing
together
that
evening
.
i
had
a
queer
time
with
aunt
today
,
and
,
as
i
got
the
best
of
it
,
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
,
began
jo
,
who
dearly
loved
to
tell
stories
.
i
was
reading
that
everlasting
belsham
,
and
droning
away
as
i
always
do
,
for
aunt
soon
drops
off
,
and
then
i
take
out
some
nice
book
,
and
read
like
fury
till
she
wakes
up
.
i
actually
made
myself
sleepy
,
and
before
she
began
to
nod
,
i
gave
such
a
gape
that
she
asked
me
what
i
meant
by
opening
my
mouth
wide
enough
to
take
the
whole
book
in
at
once
.
i
wish
i
could
,
and
be
done
with
it
,
said
i
,
trying
not
to
be
saucy
.
then
she
gave
me
a
long
lecture
on
my
sins
,
and
told
me
to
sit
and
think
them
over
while
she
just
lost
herself
for
a
moment
.
she
never
finds
herself
very
soon
,
so
the
minute
her
cap
began
to
bob
like
a
top
heavy
dahlia
,
i
whipped
the
vicar
of
wakefield
out
of
my
pocket
,
and
read
away
,
with
one
eye
on
him
and
one
on
aunt
.
i
d
just
got
to
where
they
all
tumbled
into
the
water
when
i
forgot
and
laughed
out
loud
.
aunt
woke
up
and
,
being
more
good
natured
after
her
nap
,
told
me
to
read
a
bit
and
show
what
frivolous
work
i
preferred
to
the
worthy
and
instructive
belsham
.
i
did
my
very
best
,
and
she
liked
it
,
though
she
only
said
...
i
don
t
understand
what
it
s
all
about
.
go
back
and
begin
it
,
child
.
back
i
went
,
and
made
the
primroses
as
interesting
as
ever
i
could
.
once
i
was
wicked
enough
to
stop
in
a
thrilling
place
,
and
say
meekly
,
i
m
afraid
it
tires
you
,
ma
am
.
shan
t
i
stop
now
?
she
caught
up
her
knitting
,
which
had
dropped
out
of
her
hands
,
gave
me
a
sharp
look
through
her
specs
,
and
said
,
in
her
short
way
,
finish
the
chapter
,
and
don
t
be
impertinent
,
miss
.
did
she
own
she
liked
it
?
asked
meg
.
oh
,
bless
you
,
no
!
but
she
let
old
belsham
rest
,
and
when
i
ran
back
after
my
gloves
this
afternoon
,
there
she
was
,
so
hard
at
the
vicar
that
she
didn
t
hear
me
laugh
as
i
danced
a
jig
in
the
hall
because
of
the
good
time
coming
.
what
a
pleasant
life
she
might
have
if
only
she
chose
!
i
don
t
envy
her
much
,
in
spite
of
her
money
,
for
after
all
rich
people
have
about
as
many
worries
as
poor
ones
,
i
think
,
added
jo
.
that
reminds
me
,
said
meg
,
that
i
ve
got
something
to
tell
.
it
isn
t
funny
,
like
jo
s
story
,
but
i
thought
about
it
a
good
deal
as
i
came
home
.
at
the
kings
today
i
found
everybody
in
a
flurry
,
and
one
of
the
children
said
that
her
oldest
brother
had
done
something
dreadful
,
and
papa
had
sent
him
away
.
i
heard
mrs
.
king
crying
and
mr
.
king
talking
very
loud
,
and
grace
and
ellen
turned
away
their
faces
when
they
passed
me
,
so
i
shouldn
t
see
how
red
and
swollen
their
eyes
were
.
i
didn
t
ask
any
questions
,
of
course
,
but
i
felt
so
sorry
for
them
and
was
rather
glad
i
hadn
t
any
wild
brothers
to
do
wicked
things
and
disgrace
the
family
.
i
think
being
disgraced
in
school
is
a
great
deal
try
inger
than
anything
bad
boys
can
do
,
said
amy
,
shaking
her
head
,
as
if
her
experience
of
life
had
been
a
deep
one
.
susie
perkins
came
to
school
today
with
a
lovely
red
carnelian
ring
.
i
wanted
it
dreadfully
,
and
wished
i
was
her
with
all
my
might
.
well
,
she
drew
a
picture
of
mr
.
davis
,
with
a
monstrous
nose
and
a
hump
,
and
the
words
,
young
ladies
,
my
eye
is
upon
you
!
coming
out
of
his
mouth
in
a
balloon
thing
.
we
were
laughing
over
it
when
all
of
a
sudden
his
eye
was
on
us
,
and
he
ordered
susie
to
bring
up
her
slate
.
she
was
parry
lized
with
fright
,
but
she
went
,
and
oh
,
what
do
you
think
he
did
?
he
took
her
by
the
ear
the
ear
!
just
fancy
how
horrid
!
and
led
her
to
the
recitation
platform
,
and
made
her
stand
there
half
an
hour
,
holding
the
slate
so
everyone
could
see
.
didn
t
the
girls
laugh
at
the
picture
?
asked
jo
,
who
relished
the
scrape
.
laugh
?
not
one
!
they
sat
still
as
mice
,
and
susie
cried
quarts
,
i
know
she
did
.
i
didn
t
envy
her
then
,
for
i
felt
that
millions
of
carnelian
rings
wouldn
t
have
made
me
happy
after
that
.
i
never
,
never
should
have
got
over
such
a
agonizing
mortification
.
and
amy
went
on
with
her
work
,
in
the
proud
consciousness
of
virtue
and
the
successful
utterance
of
two
long
words
in
a
breath
.
i
saw
something
i
liked
this
morning
,
and
i
meant
to
tell
it
at
dinner
,
but
i
forgot
,
said
beth
,
putting
jo
s
topsy
turvy
basket
in
order
as
she
talked
.
when
i
went
to
get
some
oysters
for
hannah
,
mr
.
laurence
was
in
the
fish
shop
,
but
he
didn
t
see
me
,
for
i
kept
behind
the
fish
barrel
,
and
he
was
busy
with
mr
.
cutter
the
fish
man
.
a
poor
woman
came
in
with
a
pail
and
a
mop
,
and
asked
mr
.
cutter
if
he
would
let
her
do
some
scrubbing
for
a
bit
of
fish
,
because
she
hadn
t
any
dinner
for
her
children
,
and
had
been
disappointed
of
a
day
s
work
.
mr
.
cutter
was
in
a
hurry
and
said
no
,
rather
crossly
,
so
she
was
going
away
,
looking
hungry
and
sorry
,
when
mr
.
laurence
hooked
up
a
big
fish
with
the
crooked
end
of
his
cane
and
held
it
out
to
her
.
she
was
so
glad
and
surprised
she
took
it
right
into
her
arms
,
and
thanked
him
over
and
over
.
he
told
her
to
go
along
and
cook
it
,
and
she
hurried
off
,
so
happy
!
wasn
t
it
good
of
him
?
oh
,
she
did
look
so
funny
,
hugging
the
big
,
slippery
fish
,
and
hoping
mr
.
laurence
s
bed
in
heaven
would
be
aisy
.
when
they
had
laughed
at
beth
s
story
,
they
asked
their
mother
for
one
,
and
after
a
moments
thought
,
she
said
soberly
,
as
i
sat
cutting
out
blue
flannel
jackets
today
at
the
rooms
,
i
felt
very
anxious
about
father
,
and
thought
how
lonely
and
helpless
we
should
be
,
if
anything
happened
to
him
.
it
was
not
a
wise
thing
to
do
,
but
i
kept
on
worrying
till
an
old
man
came
in
with
an
order
for
some
clothes
.
he
sat
down
near
me
,
and
i
began
to
talk
to
him
,
for
he
looked
poor
and
tired
and
anxious
.
have
you
sons
in
the
army
?
i
asked
,
for
the
note
he
brought
was
not
to
me
.
yes
,
ma
am
.
i
had
four
,
but
two
were
killed
,
one
is
a
prisoner
,
and
i
m
going
to
the
other
,
who
is
very
sick
in
a
washington
hospital
.
he
answered
quietly
.
you
have
done
a
great
deal
for
your
country
,
sir
,
i
said
,
feeling
respect
now
,
instead
of
pity
.
not
a
mite
more
than
i
ought
,
ma
am
.
i
d
go
myself
,
if
i
was
any
use
.
as
i
ain
t
,
i
give
my
boys
,
and
give
em
free
.
he
spoke
so
cheerfully
,
looked
so
sincere
,
and
seemed
so
glad
to
give
his
all
,
that
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
.
i
d
given
one
man
and
thought
it
too
much
,
while
he
gave
four
without
grudging
them
.
i
had
all
my
girls
to
comfort
me
at
home
,
and
his
last
son
was
waiting
,
miles
away
,
to
say
good
by
to
him
,
perhaps
!
i
felt
so
rich
,
so
happy
thinking
of
my
blessings
,
that
i
made
him
a
nice
bundle
,
gave
him
some
money
,
and
thanked
him
heartily
for
the
lesson
he
had
taught
me
.
tell
another
story
,
mother
,
one
with
a
moral
to
it
,
like
this
.
i
like
to
think
about
them
afterward
,
if
they
are
real
and
not
too
preachy
,
said
jo
,
after
a
minute
s
silence
.
mrs
.
march
smiled
and
began
at
once
,
for
she
had
told
stories
to
this
little
audience
for
many
years
,
and
knew
how
to
please
them
.
once
upon
a
time
,
there
were
four
girls
,
who
had
enough
to
eat
and
drink
and
wear
,
a
good
many
comforts
and
pleasures
,
kind
friends
and
parents
who
loved
them
dearly
,
and
yet
they
were
not
contented
.
here
the
listeners
stole
sly
looks
at
one
another
,
and
began
to
sew
diligently
.
these
girls
were
anxious
to
be
good
and
made
many
excellent
resolutions
,
but
they
did
not
keep
them
very
well
,
and
were
constantly
saying
,
if
only
we
had
this
,
or
if
we
could
only
do
that
,
quite
forgetting
how
much
they
already
had
,
and
how
many
things
they
actually
could
do
.
so
they
asked
an
old
woman
what
spell
they
could
use
to
make
them
happy
,
and
she
said
,
when
you
feel
discontented
,
think
over
your
blessings
,
and
be
grateful
.
here
jo
looked
up
quickly
,
as
if
about
to
speak
,
but
changed
her
mind
,
seeing
that
the
story
was
not
done
yet
.
being
sensible
girls
,
they
decided
to
try
her
advice
,
and
soon
were
surprised
to
see
how
well
off
they
were
.
one
discovered
that
money
couldn
t
keep
shame
and
sorrow
out
of
rich
people
s
houses
,
another
that
,
though
she
was
poor
,
she
was
a
great
deal
happier
,
with
her
youth
,
health
,
and
good
spirits
,
than
a
certain
fretful
,
feeble
old
lady
who
couldn
t
enjoy
her
comforts
,
a
third
that
,
disagreeable
as
it
was
to
help
get
dinner
,
it
was
harder
still
to
go
begging
for
it
and
the
fourth
,
that
even
carnelian
rings
were
not
so
valuable
as
good
behavior
.
so
they
agreed
to
stop
complaining
,
to
enjoy
the
blessings
already
possessed
,
and
try
to
deserve
them
,
lest
they
should
be
taken
away
entirely
,
instead
of
increased
,
and
i
believe
they
were
never
disappointed
or
sorry
that
they
took
the
old
woman
s
advice
.
now
,
marmee
,
that
is
very
cunning
of
you
to
turn
our
own
stories
against
us
,
and
give
us
a
sermon
instead
of
a
romance
!
cried
meg
.
i
like
that
kind
of
sermon
.
it
s
the
sort
father
used
to
tell
us
,
said
beth
thoughtfully
,
putting
the
needles
straight
on
jo
s
cushion
.
i
don
t
complain
near
as
much
as
the
others
do
,
and
i
shall
be
more
careful
than
ever
now
,
for
i
ve
had
warning
from
susie
s
downfall
,
said
amy
morally
.
we
needed
that
lesson
,
and
we
won
t
forget
it
.
if
we
do
so
,
you
just
say
to
us
,
as
old
chloe
did
in
uncle
tom
,
tink
ob
yer
marcies
,
chillen
!
tink
ob
yer
marcies
!
added
jo
,
who
could
not
,
for
the
life
of
her
,
help
getting
a
morsel
of
fun
out
of
the
little
sermon
,
though
she
took
it
to
heart
as
much
as
any
of
them
.
chapter
five
being
neighborly
what
in
the
world
are
you
going
to
do
now
,
jo
?
asked
meg
one
snowy
afternoon
,
as
her
sister
came
tramping
through
the
hall
,
in
rubber
boots
,
old
sack
,
and
hood
,
with
a
broom
in
one
hand
and
a
shovel
in
the
other
.
going
out
for
exercise
,
answered
jo
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
her
eyes
.
i
should
think
two
long
walks
this
morning
would
have
been
enough
!
it
s
cold
and
dull
out
,
and
i
advise
you
to
stay
warm
and
dry
by
the
fire
,
as
i
do
,
said
meg
with
a
shiver
.
never
take
advice
!
can
t
keep
still
all
day
,
and
not
being
a
pussycat
,
i
don
t
like
to
doze
by
the
fire
.
i
like
adventures
,
and
i
m
going
to
find
some
.
meg
went
back
to
toast
her
feet
and
read
ivanhoe
,
and
jo
began
to
dig
paths
with
great
energy
.
the
snow
was
light
,
and
with
her
broom
she
soon
swept
a
path
all
round
the
garden
,
for
beth
to
walk
in
when
the
sun
came
out
and
the
invalid
dolls
needed
air
.
now
,
the
garden
separated
the
marches
house
from
that
of
mr
.
laurence
.
both
stood
in
a
suburb
of
the
city
,
which
was
still
country
like
,
with
groves
and
lawns
,
large
gardens
,
and
quiet
streets
.
a
low
hedge
parted
the
two
estates
.
on
one
side
was
an
old
,
brown
house
,
looking
rather
bare
and
shabby
,
robbed
of
the
vines
that
in
summer
covered
its
walls
and
the
flowers
,
which
then
surrounded
it
.
on
the
other
side
was
a
stately
stone
mansion
,
plainly
betokening
every
sort
of
comfort
and
luxury
,
from
the
big
coach
house
and
well
kept
grounds
to
the
conservatory
and
the
glimpses
of
lovely
things
one
caught
between
the
rich
curtains
.
yet
it
seemed
a
lonely
,
lifeless
sort
of
house
,
for
no
children
frolicked
on
the
lawn
,
no
motherly
face
ever
smiled
at
the
windows
,
and
few
people
went
in
and
out
,
except
the
old
gentleman
and
his
grandson
.
to
jo
s
lively
fancy
,
this
fine
house
seemed
a
kind
of
enchanted
palace
,
full
of
splendors
and
delights
which
no
one
enjoyed
.
she
had
long
wanted
to
behold
these
hidden
glories
,
and
to
know
the
laurence
boy
,
who
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
be
known
,
if
he
only
knew
how
to
begin
.
since
the
party
,
she
had
been
more
eager
than
ever
,
and
had
planned
many
ways
of
making
friends
with
him
,
but
he
had
not
been
seen
lately
,
and
jo
began
to
think
he
had
gone
away
,
when
she
one
day
spied
a
brown
face
at
an
upper
window
,
looking
wistfully
down
into
their
garden
,
where
beth
and
amy
were
snow
balling
one
another
.
that
boy
is
suffering
for
society
and
fun
,
she
said
to
herself
.
his
grandpa
does
not
know
what
s
good
for
him
,
and
keeps
him
shut
up
all
alone
.
he
needs
a
party
of
jolly
boys
to
play
with
,
or
somebody
young
and
lively
.
i
ve
a
great
mind
to
go
over
and
tell
the
old
gentleman
so
!
the
idea
amused
jo
,
who
liked
to
do
daring
things
and
was
always
scandalizing
meg
by
her
queer
performances
.
the
plan
of
going
over
was
not
forgotten
.
and
when
the
snowy
afternoon
came
,
jo
resolved
to
try
what
could
be
done
.
she
saw
mr
.
lawrence
drive
off
,
and
then
sallied
out
to
dig
her
way
down
to
the
hedge
,
where
she
paused
and
took
a
survey
.
all
quiet
,
curtains
down
at
the
lower
windows
,
servants
out
of
sight
,
and
nothing
human
visible
but
a
curly
black
head
leaning
on
a
thin
hand
at
the
upper
window
.
there
he
is
,
thought
jo
,
poor
boy
!
all
alone
and
sick
this
dismal
day
.
it
s
a
shame
!
i
ll
toss
up
a
snowball
and
make
him
look
out
,
and
then
say
a
kind
word
to
him
.
up
went
a
handful
of
soft
snow
,
and
the
head
turned
at
once
,
showing
a
face
which
lost
its
listless
look
in
a
minute
,
as
the
big
eyes
brightened
and
the
mouth
began
to
smile
.
jo
nodded
and
laughed
,
and
flourished
her
broom
as
she
called
out
...
how
do
you
do
?
are
you
sick
?
laurie
opened
the
window
,
and
croaked
out
as
hoarsely
as
a
raven
...
better
,
thank
you
.
i
ve
had
a
bad
cold
,
and
been
shut
up
a
week
.
i
m
sorry
.

do
you
amuse
yourself
with
?
nothing
.

dull
as
tombs
up
here
.

much
.

won
t
let
me
.
can
t
somebody

to
you
?
grandpa
does
sometimes
,
but
my
books
don
t
interest
him
,
and
i
hate
to
ask
brooke
all
the
time
.
have
someone
come
and
see
you
then
.
there
isn
t
anyone
i
d
like
to
see
.
boys
make
such
a
row
,
and
my
head
is
weak
.
isn
t

some
nice
girl
who

read
and
amuse
you
?
girls

quiet
and
like
to
play
nurse
.

t
know
any
.

,
began
jo
,
then
laughed
and
stopped
.
so
i
do
!
will
you
come
,
please
?
cried
laurie
.
i
m
not
quiet
and
nice
,
but
i
ll
come
,
if
mother
will
let
me
.
i
ll
go
ask
her
.
shut
the
window
,
like
a
good
boy
,
and
wait
till
i
come
.
with
that
,
jo
shouldered
her
broom
and
marched
into
the
house
,
wondering
what
they
would
all
say
to
her
.
laurie
was
in
a
flutter
of
excitement
at
the
idea
of
having
company
,
and
flew
about
to
get
ready
,
for
as
mrs
.
march
said
,
he
was
a
little
gentleman
,
and
did
honor
to
the
coming
guest
by
brushing
his
curly
pate
,
putting
on
a
fresh
color
,
and
trying
to
tidy
up
the
room
,
which
in
spite
of
half
a
dozen
servants
,
was
anything
but
neat
.
presently
there
came
a
loud
ring
,
than
a
decided
voice
,
asking
for
mr
.
laurie
,
and
a
surprised
looking
servant
came
running
up
to
announce
a
young
lady
.
all
right
,
show
her
up
,
it
s
miss
jo
,
said
laurie
,
going
to
the
door
of
his
little
parlor
to
meet
jo
,
who
appeared
,
looking
rosy
and
quite
at
her
ease
,
with
a
covered
dish
in
one
hand
and
beth
s
three
kittens
in
the
other
.
here
i
am
,
bag
and
baggage
,
she
said
briskly
.
mother
sent
her
love
,
and
was
glad
if
i
could
do
anything
for
you
.
meg
wanted
me
to
bring
some
of
her
blanc
mange
,
she
makes
it
very
nicely
,
and
beth
thought
her
cats
would
be
comforting
.
i
knew
you
d
laugh
at
them
,
but
i
couldn
t
refuse
,
she
was
so
anxious
to
do
something
.
it
so
happened
that
beth
s
funny
loan
was
just
the
thing
,
for
in
laughing
over
the
kits
,
laurie
forgot
his
bashfulness
,
and
grew
sociable
at
once
.
that
looks
too
pretty
to
eat
,
he
said
,
smiling
with
pleasure
,
as
jo
uncovered
the
dish
,
and
showed
the
blanc
mange
,
surrounded
by
a
garland
of
green
leaves
,
and
the
scarlet
flowers
of
amy
s
pet
geranium
.
it
isn
t
anything
,
only
they
all
felt
kindly
and
wanted
to
show
it
.
tell
the
girl
to
put
it
away
for
your
tea
.
it
s
so
simple
you
can
eat
it
,
and
being
soft
,
it
will
slip
down
without
hurting
your
sore
throat
.
what
a
cozy
room
this
is
!
it
might
be
if
it
was
kept
nice
,
but
the
maids
are
lazy
,
and
i
don
t
know
how
to
make
them
mind
.
it
worries
me
though
.
i
ll
right
it
up
in
two
minutes
,
for
it
only
needs
to
have
the
hearth
brushed
,
so
and
the
things
made
straight
on
the
mantelpiece
,
so
and
the
books
put
here
,
and
the
bottles
there
,
and
your
sofa
turned
from
the
light
,
and
the
pillows
plumped
up
a
bit
.
now
then
,
you
re
fixed
.
and
so
he
was
,
for
,
as
she
laughed
and
talked
,
jo
had
whisked
things
into
place
and
given
quite
a
different
air
to
the
room
.
laurie
watched
her
in
respectful
silence
,
and
when
she
beckoned
him
to
his
sofa
,
he
sat
down
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
,
saying
gratefully
...
how
kind
you
are
!
yes
,
that
s
what
it
wanted
.
now
please
take
the
big
chair
and
let
me
do
something
to
amuse
my
company
.
no
,
i
came
to
amuse
you
.
shall
i
read
aloud
?
and
jo
looked
affectionately
toward
some
inviting
books
near
by
.
thank
you
!
i
ve
read
all
those
,
and
if
you
don
t
mind
,
i
d
rather
talk
,
answered
laurie
.
not
a
bit
.
i
ll
talk
all
day
if
you
ll
only
set
me
going
.
beth
says
i
never
know
when
to
stop
.
is
beth
the
rosy
one
,
who
stays
at
home
good
deal
and
sometimes
goes
out
with
a
little
basket
?
asked
laurie
with
interest
.
yes
,
that
s
beth
.
she
s
my
girl
,
and
a
regular
good
one
she
is
,
too
.
the
pretty
one
is
meg
,
and
the
curly
haired
one
is
amy
,
i
believe
?
how
did
you
find
that
out
?
laurie
colored
up
,
but
answered
frankly
,
why
,
you
see
i
often
hear
you
calling
to
one
another
,
and
when
i
m
alone
up
here
,
i
can
t
help
looking
over
at
your
house
,
you
always
seem
to
be
having
such
good
times
.
i
beg
your
pardon
for
being
so
rude
,
but
sometimes
you
forget
to
put
down
the
curtain
at
the
window
where
the
flowers
are
.
and
when
the
lamps
are
lighted
,
it
s
like
looking
at
a
picture
to
see
the
fire
,
and
you
all
around
the
table
with
your
mother
.
her
face
is
right
opposite
,
and
it
looks
so
sweet
behind
the
flowers
,
i
can
t
help
watching
it
.
i
haven
t
got
any
mother
,
you
know
.
and
laurie
poked
the
fire
to
hide
a
little
twitching
of
the
lips
that
he
could
not
control
.
the
solitary
,
hungry
look
in
his
eyes
went
straight
to
jo
s
warm
heart
.
she
had
been
so
simply
taught
that
there
was
no
nonsense
in
her
head
,
and
at
fifteen
she
was
as
innocent
and
frank
as
any
child
.
laurie
was
sick
and
lonely
,
and
feeling
how
rich
she
was
in
home
and
happiness
,
she
gladly
tried
to
share
it
with
him
.
her
face
was
very
friendly
and
her
sharp
voice
unusually
gentle
as
she
said
...
we
ll
never
draw
that
curtain
any
more
,
and
i
give
you
leave
to
look
as
much
as
you
like
.
i
just
wish
,
though
,
instead
of
peeping
,
you
d
come
over
and
see
us
.
mother
is
so
splendid
,
she
d
do
you
heaps
of
good
,
and
beth
would
sing
to
you
if
i
begged
her
to
,
and
amy
would
dance
.
meg
and
i
would
make
you
laugh
over
our
funny
stage
properties
,
and
we
d
have
jolly
times
.
wouldn
t
your
grandpa
let
you
?
i
think
he
would
,
if
your
mother
asked
him
.
he
s
very
kind
,
though
he
does
not
look
so
,
and
he
lets
me
do
what
i
like
,
pretty
much
,
only
he
s
afraid
i
might
be
a
bother
to
strangers
,
began
laurie
,
brightening
more
and
more
.
we
are
not
strangers
,
we
are
neighbors
,
and
you
needn
t
think
you
d
be
a
bother
.
we
want
to
know
you
,
and
i
ve
been
trying
to
do
it
this
ever
so
long
.
we
haven
t
been
here
a
great
while
,
you
know
,
but
we
have
got
acquainted
with
all
our
neighbors
but
you
.
you
see
,
grandpa
lives
among
his
books
,
and
doesn
t
mind
much
what
happens
outside
.
mr
.
brooke
,
my
tutor
,
doesn
t
stay
here
,
you
know
,
and
i
have
no
one
to
go
about
with
me
,
so
i
just
stop
at
home
and
get
on
as
i
can
.
that
s
bad
.
you
ought
to
make
an
effort
and
go
visiting
everywhere
you
are
asked
,
then
you
ll
have
plenty
of
friends
,
and
pleasant
places
to
go
to
.
never
mind
being
bashful
.
it
won
t
last
long
if
you
keep
going
.
laurie
turned
red
again
,
but
wasn
t
offended
at
being
accused
of
bashfulness
,
for
there
was
so
much
good
will
in
jo
it
was
impossible
not
to
take
her
blunt
speeches
as
kindly
as
they
were
meant
.
do
you
like
your
school
?
asked
the
boy
,
changing
the
subject
,
after
a
little
pause
,
during
which
he
stared
at
the
fire
and
jo
looked
about
her
,
well
pleased
.
don
t
go
to
school
,
i
m
a
businessman
girl
,
i
mean
.
i
go
to
wait
on
my
great
aunt
,
and
a
dear
,
cross
old
soul
she
is
,
too
,
answered
jo
.
laurie
opened
his
mouth
to
ask
another
question
,
but
remembering
just
in
time
that
it
wasn
t
manners
to
make
too
many
inquiries
into
people
s
affairs
,
he
shut
it
again
,
and
looked
uncomfortable
.
jo
liked
his
good
breeding
,
and
didn
t
mind
having
a
laugh
at
aunt
march
,
so
she
gave
him
a
lively
description
of
the
fidgety
old
lady
,
her
fat
poodle
,
the
parrot
that
talked
spanish
,
and
the
library
where
she
reveled
.
laurie
enjoyed
that
immensely
,
and
when
she
told
about
the
prim
old
gentleman
who
came
once
to
woo
aunt
march
,
and
in
the
middle
of
a
fine
speech
,
how
poll
had
tweaked
his
wig
off
to
his
great
dismay
,
the
boy
lay
back
and
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
,
and
a
maid
popped
her
head
in
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
oh
!
that
does
me
no
end
of
good
.
tell
on
,
please
,
he
said
,
taking
his
face
out
of
the
sofa
cushion
,
red
and
shining
with
merriment
.
much
elated
with
her
success
,
jo
did
tell
on
,
all
about
their
plays
and
plans
,
their
hopes
and
fears
for
father
,
and
the
most
interesting
events
of
the
little
world
in
which
the
sisters
lived
.
then
they
got
to
talking
about
books
,
and
to
jo
s
delight
,
she
found
that
laurie
loved
them
as
well
as
she
did
,
and
had
read
even
more
than
herself
.
if
you
like
them
so
much
,
come
down
and
see
ours
.
grandfather
is
out
,
so
you
needn
t
be
afraid
,
said
laurie
,
getting
up
.
i
m
not
afraid
of
anything
,
returned
jo
,
with
a
toss
of
the
head
.
i
don
t
believe
you
are
!
exclaimed
the
boy
,
looking
at
her
with
much
admiration
,
though
he
privately
thought
she
would
have
good
reason
to
be
a
trifle
afraid
of
the
old
gentleman
,
if
she
met
him
in
some
of
his
moods
.
the
atmosphere
of
the
whole
house
being
summerlike
,
laurie
led
the
way
from
room
to
room
,
letting
jo
stop
to
examine
whatever
struck
her
fancy
.
and
so
,
at
last
they
came
to
the
library
,
where
she
clapped
her
hands
and
pranced
,
as
she
always
did
when
especially
delighted
.
it
was
lined
with
books
,
and
there
were
pictures
and
statues
,
and
distracting
little
cabinets
full
of
coins
and
curiosities
,
and
sleepy
hollow
chairs
,
and
queer
tables
,
and
bronzes
,
and
best
of
all
,
a
great
open
fireplace
with
quaint
tiles
all
round
it
.
what
richness
!
sighed
jo
,
sinking
into
the
depth
of
a
velour
chair
and
gazing
about
her
with
an
air
of
intense
satisfaction
.
theodore
laurence
,
you
ought
to
be
the
happiest
boy
in
the
world
,
she
added
impressively
.
a
fellow
can
t
live
on
books
,
said
laurie
,
shaking
his
head
as
he
perched
on
a
table
opposite
.
before
he
could
more
,
a
bell
rang
,
and
jo
flew
up
,
exclaiming
with
alarm
,
mercy
me
!
it
s
your
grandpa
!
well
,
what
if
it
is
?
you
are
not
afraid
of
anything
,
you
know
,
returned
the
boy
,
looking
wicked
.
i
think
i
am
a
little
bit
afraid
of
him
,
but
i
don
t
know
why
i
should
be
.
marmee
said
i
might
come
,
and
i
don
t
think
you
re
any
the
worse
for
it
,
said
jo
,
composing
herself
,
though
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
door
.
i
m
a
great
deal
better
for
it
,
and
ever
so
much
obliged
.
i
m
only
afraid
you
are
very
tired
of
talking
to
me
.
it
was
so
pleasant
,
i
couldn
t
bear
to
stop
,
said
laurie
gratefully
.
the
doctor
to
see
you
,
sir
,
and
the
maid
beckoned
as
she
spoke
.
would
you
mind
if
i
left
you
for
a
minute
?
i
suppose
i
must
see
him
,
said
laurie
.
don
t
mind
me
.
i
m
happy
as
a
cricket
here
,
answered
jo
.
laurie
went
away
,
and
his
guest
amused
herself
in
her
own
way
.
she
was
standing
before
a
fine
portrait
of
the
old
gentleman
when
the
door
opened
again
,
and
without
turning
,
she
said
decidedly
,
i
m
sure
now
that
i
shouldn
t
be
afraid
of
him
,
for
he
s
got
kind
eyes
,
though
his
mouth
is
grim
,
and
he
looks
as
if
he
had
a
tremendous
will
of
his
own
.
he
isn
t
as
handsome
as
my
grandfather
,
but
i
like
him
.
thank
you
,
ma
am
,
said
a
gruff
voice
behind
her
,
and
there
,
to
her
great
dismay
,
stood
old
mr
.
laurence
.
poor
jo
blushed
till
she
couldn
t
blush
any
redder
,
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
uncomfortably
fast
as
she
thought
what
she
had
said
.
for
a
minute
a
wild
desire
to
run
away
possessed
her
,
but
that
was
cowardly
,
and
the
girls
would
laugh
at
her
,
so
she
resolved
to
stay
and
get
out
of
the
scrape
as
she
could
.
a
second
look
showed
her
that
the
living
eyes
,
under
the
bushy
eyebrows
,
were
kinder
even
than
the
painted
ones
,
and
there
was
a
sly
twinkle
in
them
,
which
lessened
her
fear
a
good
deal
.
the
gruff
voice
was
gruffer
than
ever
,
as
the
old
gentleman
said
abruptly
,
after
the
dreadful
pause
,
so
you
re
not
afraid
of
me
,
hey
?
not
much
,
sir
.
and
you
don
t
think
me
as
handsome
as
your
grandfather
?
not
quite
,
sir
.
and
i
ve
got
a
tremendous
will
,
have
i
?
i
only
said
i
thought
so
.
but
you
like
me
in
spite
of
it
?
yes
,
i
do
,
sir
.
that
answer
pleased
the
old
gentleman
.
he
gave
a
short
laugh
,
shook
hands
with
her
,
and
,
putting
his
finger
under
her
chin
,
turned
up
her
face
,
examined
it
gravely
,
and
let
it
go
,
saying
with
a
nod
,
you
ve
got
your
grandfather
s
spirit
,
if
you
haven
t
his
face
.
he
was
a
fine
man
,
my
dear
,
but
what
is
better
,
he
was
a
brave
and
an
honest
one
,
and
i
was
proud
to
be
his
friend
.
thank
you
,
sir
,
and
jo
was
quite
comfortable
after
that
,
for
it
suited
her
exactly
.
what
have
you
been
doing
to
this
boy
of
mine
,
hey
?
was
the
next
question
,
sharply
put
.
only
trying
to
be
neighborly
,
sir
.
and
jo
told
how
her
visit
came
about
.
you
think
he
needs
cheering
up
a
bit
,
do
you
?
yes
,
sir
,
he
seems
a
little
lonely
,
and
young
folks
would
do
him
good
perhaps
.
we
are
only
girls
,
but
we
should
be
glad
to
help
if
we
could
,
for
we
don
t
forget
the
splendid
christmas
present
you
sent
us
,
said
jo
eagerly
.
tut
,
tut
,
tut
!
that
was
the
boy
s
affair
.
how
is
the
poor
woman
?
doing
nicely
,
sir
.
and
off
went
jo
,
talking
very
fast
,
as
she
told
all
about
the
hummels
,
in
whom
her
mother
had
interested
richer
friends
than
they
were
.
just
her
father
s
way
of
doing
good
.
i
shall
come
and
see
your
mother
some
fine
day
.
tell
her
so
.
there
s
the
tea
bell
,
we
have
it
early
on
the
boy
s
account
.
come
down
and
go
on
being
neighborly
.
if
you
d
like
to
have
me
,
sir
.
shouldn
t
ask
you
,
if
i
didn
t
.
and
mr
.
laurence
offered
her
his
arm
with
old
fashioned
courtesy
.
what
would
meg
say
to
this
?
thought
jo
,
as
she
was
marched
away
,
while
her
eyes
danced
with
fun
as
she
imagined
herself
telling
the
story
at
home
.
hey
!
why
,
what
the
dickens
has
come
to
the
fellow
?
said
the
old
gentleman
,
as
laurie
came
running
downstairs
and
brought
up
with
a
start
of
surprise
at
the
astounding
sight
of
jo
arm
in
arm
with
his
redoubtable
grandfather
.
i
didn
t
know
you
d
come
,
sir
,
he
began
,
as
jo
gave
him
a
triumphant
little
glance
.
that
s
evident
,
by
the
way
you
racket
downstairs
.
come
to
your
tea
,
sir
,
and
behave
like
a
gentleman
.
and
having
pulled
the
boy
s
hair
by
way
of
a
caress
,
mr
.
laurence
walked
on
,
while
laurie
went
through
a
series
of
comic
evolutions
behind
their
backs
,
which
nearly
produced
an
explosion
of
laughter
from
jo
.
the
old
gentleman
did
not
say
much
as
he
drank
his
four
cups
of
tea
,
but
he
watched
the
young
people
,
who
soon
chatted
away
like
old
friends
,
and
the
change
in
his
grandson
did
not
escape
him
.
there
was
color
,
light
,
and
life
in
the
boy
s
face
now
,
vivacity
in
his
manner
,
and
genuine
merriment
in
his
laugh
.
she
s
right
,
the
lad
is
lonely
.
i
ll
see
what
these
little
girls
can
do
for
him
,
thought
mr
.
laurence
,
as
he
looked
and
listened
.
he
liked
jo
,
for
her
odd
,
blunt
ways
suited
him
,
and
she
seemed
to
understand
the
boy
almost
as
well
as
if
she
had
been
one
herself
.
if
the
laurences
had
been
what
jo
called
prim
and
poky
,
she
would
not
have
got
on
at
all
,
for
such
people
always
made
her
shy
and
awkward
.
but
finding
them
free
and
easy
,
she
was
so
herself
,
and
made
a
good
impression
.
when
they
rose
she
proposed
to
go
,
but
laurie
said
he
had
something
more
to
show
her
,
and
took
her
away
to
the
conservatory
,
which
had
been
lighted
for
her
benefit
.
it
seemed
quite
fairylike
to
jo
,
as
she
went
up
and
down
the
walks
,
enjoying
the
blooming
walls
on
either
side
,
the
soft
light
,
the
damp
sweet
air
,
and
the
wonderful
vines
and
trees
that
hung
about
her
,
while
her
new
friend
cut
the
finest
flowers
till
his
hands
were
full
.
then
he
tied
them
up
,
saying
,
with
the
happy
look
jo
liked
to
see
,
please
give
these
to
your
mother
,
and
tell
her
i
like
the
medicine
she
sent
me
very
much
.
they
found
mr
.
laurence
standing
before
the
fire
in
the
great
drawing
room
,
but
jo
s
attention
was
entirely
absorbed
by
a
grand
piano
,
which
stood
open
.
do
you
play
?
she
asked
,
turning
to
laurie
with
a
respectful
expression
.
sometimes
,
he
answered
modestly
.
please
do
now
.
i
want
to
hear
it
,
so
i
can
tell
beth
.
won
t
you
first
?
don
t
know
how
.
too
stupid
to
learn
,
but
i
love
music
dearly
.
so
laurie
played
and
jo
listened
,
with
her
nose
luxuriously
buried
in
heliotrope
and
tea
roses
.
her
respect
and
regard
for
the
laurence
boy
increased
very
much
,
for
he
played
remarkably
well
and
didn
t
put
on
any
airs
.
she
wished
beth
could
hear
him
,
but
she
did
not
say
so
,
only
praised
him
till
he
was
quite
abashed
,
and
his
grandfather
came
to
his
rescue
.
that
will
do
,
that
will
do
,
young
lady
.
too
many
sugarplums
are
not
good
for
him
.
his
music
isn
t
bad
,
but
i
hope
he
will
do
as
well
in
more
important
things
.

,
i
m
much
obliged
to
you
,
and
i
hope
you
ll
come
again
.
my
respects
to
your
mother
.
good
night
,
doctor
jo
.
he
shook
hands
kindly
,
but
looked
as
if
something
did
not
please
him
.
when
they
got
into
the
hall
,
jo
asked
laurie
if
she
had
said
something
amiss
.
he
shook
his
head
.
no
,
it
was
me
.
he
doesn
t
like
to
hear
me
play
.
why
not
?
i
ll
tell
you
some
day
.
john
is
going
home
with
you
,
as
i
can
t
.
no
need
of
that
.
i
am
not
a
young
lady
,
and
it
s
only
a
step
.
take
care
of
yourself
,
won
t
you
?
yes
,
but
you
will
come
again
,
i
hope
?
if
you
promise
to
come
and
see
us
after
you
are
well
.
i
will
.
good
night
,
laurie
!
good
night
,
jo
,
good
night
!
when
all
the
afternoon
s
adventures
had
been
told
,
the
family
felt
inclined
to
go
visiting
in
a
body
,
for
each
found
something
very
attractive
in
the
big
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
.
mrs
.
march
wanted
to
talk
of
her
father
with
the
old
man
who
had
not
forgotten
him
,
meg
longed
to
walk
in
the
conservatory
,
beth
sighed
for
the
grand
piano
,
and
amy
was
eager
to
see
the
fine
pictures
and
statues
.
mother
,
why
didn
t
mr
.
laurence
like
to
have
laurie
play
?
asked
jo
,
who
was
of
an
inquiring
disposition
.
i
am
not
sure
,
but
i
think
it
was
because
his
son
,
laurie
s
father
,
married
an
italian
lady
,
a
musician
,
which
displeased
the
old
man
,
who
is
very
proud
.
the
lady
was
good
and
lovely
and
accomplished
,
but
he
did
not
like
her
,
and
never
saw
his
son
after
he
married
.
they
both
died
when
laurie
was
a
little
child
,
and
then
his
grandfather
took
him
home
.
i
fancy
the
boy
,
who
was
born
in
italy
,
is
not
very
strong
,
and
the
old
man
is
afraid
of
losing
him
,
which
makes
him
so
careful
.
laurie
comes
naturally
by
his
love
of
music
,
for
he
is
like
his
mother
,
and
i
dare
say
his
grandfather
fears
that
he
may
want
to
be
a
musician
.
at
any
rate
,
his
skill
reminds
him
of
the
woman
he
did
not
like
,
and
so
he
glowered
as
jo
said
.
dear
me
,
how
romantic
!
exclaimed
meg
.
how
silly
!
said
jo
.
let
him
be
a
musician
if
he
wants
to
,
and
not
plague
his
life
out
sending
him
to
college
,
when
he
hates
to
go
.
that
s
why
he
has
such
handsome
black
eyes
and
pretty
manners
,
i
suppose
.
italians
are
always
nice
,
said
meg
,
who
was
a
little
sentimental
.
what
do
you
know
about
his
eyes
and
his
manners
?
you
never
spoke
to
him
,
hardly
,
cried
jo
,
who
was
not
sentimental
.
i
saw
him
at
the
party
,
and
what
you
tell
shows
that
he
knows
how
to
behave
.
that
was
a
nice
little
speech
about
the
medicine
mother
sent
him
.
he
meant
the
blanc
mange
,
i
suppose
.
how
stupid
you
are
,
child
!
he
meant
you
,
of
course
.
did
he
?
and
jo
opened
her
eyes
as
if
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
.
i
never
saw
such
a
girl
!
you
don
t
know
a
compliment
when
you
get
it
,
said
meg
,
with
the
air
of
a
young
lady
who
knew
all
about
the
matter
.
i
think
they
are
great
nonsense
,
and
i
ll
thank
you
not
to
be
silly
and
spoil
my
fun
.
laurie
s
a
nice
boy
and
i
like
him
,
and
i
won
t
have
any
sentimental
stuff
about
compliments
and
such
rubbish
.
we
ll
all
be
good
to
him
because
he
hasn
t
got
any
mother
,
and
he
may
come
over
and
see
us
,
mayn
t
he
,
marmee
?
yes
,
jo
,
your
little
friend
is
very
welcome
,
and
i
hope
meg
will
remember
that
children
should
be
children
as
long
as
they
can
.
i
don
t
call
myself
a
child
,
and
i
m
not
in
my
teens
yet
,
observed
amy
.
what
do
you
say
,
beth
?
i
was
thinking
about
our
pilgrim
s
progress
,
answered
beth
,
who
had
not
heard
a
word
.
how
we
got
out
of
the
slough
and
through
the
wicket
gate
by
resolving
to
be
good
,
and
up
the
steep
hill
by
trying
,
and
that
maybe
the
house
over
there
,
full
of
splendid
things
,
is
going
to
be
our
palace
beautiful
.
we
have
got
to
get
by
the
lions
first
,
said
jo
,
as
if
she
rather
liked
the
prospect
.
chapter
six
beth
finds
the
palace
beautiful
the
big
house
did
prove
a
palace
beautiful
,
though
it
took
some
time
for
all
to
get
in
,
and
beth
found
it
very
hard
to
pass
the
lions
.
old
mr
.
laurence
was
the
biggest
one
,
but
after
he
had
called
,
said
something
funny
or
kind
to
each
one
of
the
girls
,
and
talked
over
old
times
with
their
mother
,
nobody
felt
much
afraid
of
him
,
except
timid
beth
.
the
other
lion
was
the
fact
that
they
were
poor
and
laurie
rich
,
for
this
made
them
shy
of
accepting
favors
which
they
could
not
return
.
but
,
after
a
while
,
they
found
that
he
considered
them
the
benefactors
,
and
could
not
do
enough
to
show
how
grateful
he
was
for
mrs
.
march
s
motherly
welcome
,
their
cheerful
society
,
and
the
comfort
he
took
in
that
humble
home
of
theirs
.
so
they
soon
forgot
their
pride
and
interchanged
kindnesses
without
stopping
to
think
which
was
the
greater
.
all
sorts
of
pleasant
things
happened
about
that
time
,
for
the
new
friendship
flourished
like
grass
in
spring
.
every
one
liked
laurie
,
and
he
privately
informed
his
tutor
that
the
marches
were
regularly
splendid
girls
.
with
the
delightful
enthusiasm
of
youth
,
they
took
the
solitary
boy
into
their
midst
and
made
much
of
him
,
and
he
found
something
very
charming
in
the
innocent
companionship
of
these
simple
hearted
girls
.
never
having
known
mother
or
sisters
,
he
was
quick
to
feel
the
influences
they
brought
about
him
,
and
their
busy
,
lively
ways
made
him
ashamed
of
the
indolent
life
he
led
.
he
was
tired
of
books
,
and
found
people
so
interesting
now
that
mr
.
brooke
was
obliged
to
make
very
unsatisfactory
reports
,
for
laurie
was
always
playing
truant
and
running
over
to
the
marches
.
never
mind
,
let
him
take
a
holiday
,
and
make
it
up
afterward
,
said
the
old
gentleman
.
the
good
lady
next
door
says
he
is
studying
too
hard
and
needs
young
society
,
amusement
,
and
exercise
.
i
suspect
she
is
right
,
and
that
i
ve
been
coddling
the
fellow
as
if
i
d
been
his
grandmother
.
let
him
do
what
he
likes
,
as
long
as
he
is
happy
.
he
can
t
get
into
mischief
in
that
little
nunnery
over
there
,
and
mrs
.
march
is
doing
more
for
him
than
we
can
.
what
good
times
they
had
,
to
be
sure
.
such
plays
and
tableaux
,
such
sleigh
rides
and
skating
frolics
,
such
pleasant
evenings
in
the
old
parlor
,
and
now
and
then
such
gay
little
parties
at
the
great
house
.
meg
could
walk
in
the
conservatory
whenever
she
liked
and
revel
in
bouquets
,
jo
browsed
over
the
new
library
voraciously
,
and
convulsed
the
old
gentleman
with
her
criticisms
,
amy
copied
pictures
and
enjoyed
beauty
to
her
heart
s
content
,
and
laurie
played
lord
of
the
manor
in
the
most
delightful
style
.
but
beth
,
though
yearning
for
the
grand
piano
,
could
not
pluck
up
courage
to
go
to
the
mansion
of
bliss
,
as
meg
called
it
.
she
went
once
with
jo
,
but
the
old
gentleman
,
not
being
aware
of
her
infirmity
,
stared
at
her
so
hard
from
under
his
heavy
eyebrows
,
and
said
hey
!
so
loud
,
that
he
frightened
her
so
much
her
feet
chattered
on
the
floor
,
she
never
told
her
mother
,
and
she
ran
away
,
declaring
she
would
never
go
there
any
more
,
not
even
for
the
dear
piano
.
no
persuasions
or
enticements
could
overcome
her
fear
,
till
,
the
fact
coming
to
mr
.
laurence
s
ear
in
some
mysterious
way
,
he
set
about
mending
matters
.
during
one
of
the
brief
calls
he
made
,
he
artfully
led
the
conversation
to
music
,
and
talked
away
about
great
singers
whom
he
had
seen
,
fine
organs
he
had
heard
,
and
told
such
charming
anecdotes
that
beth
found
it
impossible
to
stay
in
her
distant
corner
,
but
crept
nearer
and
nearer
,
as
if
fascinated
.
at
the
back
of
his
chair
she
stopped
and
stood
listening
,
with
her
great
eyes
wide
open
and
her
cheeks
red
with
excitement
of
this
unusual
performance
.
taking
no
more
notice
of
her
than
if
she
had
been
a
fly
,
mr
.
laurence
talked
on
about
laurie
s
lessons
and
teachers
.
and
presently
,
as
if
the
idea
had
just
occurred
to
him
,
he
said
to
mrs
.
march
...
the
boy
neglects
his
music
now
,
and
i
m
glad
of
it
,
for
he
was
getting
too
fond
of
it
.
but
the
piano
suffers
for
want
of
use
.
wouldn
t
some
of
your
girls
like
to
run
over
,
and
practice
on
it
now
and
then
,
just
to
keep
it
in
tune
,
you
know
,
ma
am
?
beth
took
a
step
forward
,
and
pressed
her
hands
tightly
together
to
keep
from
clapping
them
,
for
this
was
an
irresistible
temptation
,
and
the
thought
of
practicing
on
that
splendid
instrument
quite
took
her
breath
away
.
before
mrs
.
march
could
reply
,
mr
.
laurence
went
on
with
an
odd
little
nod
and
smile
...
they
needn
t
see
or
speak
to
anyone
,
but
run
in
at
any
time
.
for
i
m
shut
up
in
my
study
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
,
laurie
is
out
a
great
deal
,
and
the
servants
are
never
near
the
drawing
room
after
nine
o
clock
.
here
he
rose
,
as
if
going
,
and
beth
made
up
her
mind
to
speak
,
for
that
last
arrangement
left
nothing
to
be
desired
.
please
,
tell
the
young
ladies
what
i
say
,
and
if
they
don
t
care
to
come
,
why
,
never
mind
.
here
a
little
hand
slipped
into
his
,
and
beth
looked
up
at
him
with
a
face
full
of
gratitude
,
as
she
said
,
in
her
earnest
yet
timid
way
...
oh
sir
,
they
do
care
,
very
very
much
!
are
you
the
musical
girl
?
he
asked
,
without
any
startling
hey
!
as
he
looked
down
at
her
very
kindly
.
i
m
beth
.
i
love
it
dearly
,
and
i
ll
come
,
if
you
are
quite
sure
nobody
will
hear
me
,
and
be
disturbed
,
she
added
,
fearing
to
be
rude
,
and
trembling
at
her
own
boldness
as
she
spoke
.
not
a
soul
,
my
dear
.
the
house
is
empty
half
the
day
,
so
come
and
drum
away
as
much
as
you
like
,
and
i
shall
be
obliged
to
you
.
how
kind
you
are
,
sir
!
beth
blushed
like
a
rose
under
the
friendly
look
he
wore
,
but
she
was
not
frightened
now
,
and
gave
the
hand
a
grateful
squeeze
because
she
had
no
words
to
thank
him
for
the
precious
gift
he
had
given
her
.
the
old
gentleman
softly
stroked
the
hair
off
her
forehead
,
and
,
stooping
down
,
he
kissed
her
,
saying
,
in
a
tone
few
people
ever
heard
...
i
had
a
little
girl
once
,
with
eyes
like
these
.
god
bless
you
,
my
dear
!
good
day
,
madam
.
and
away
he
went
,
in
a
great
hurry
.
beth
had
a
rapture
with
her
mother
,
and
then
rushed
up
to
impart
the
glorious
news
to
her
family
of
invalids
,
as
the
girls
were
not
home
.
how
blithely
she
sang
that
evening
,
and
how
they
all
laughed
at
her
because
she
woke
amy
in
the
night
by
playing
the
piano
on
her
face
in
her
sleep
.
next
day
,
having
seen
both
the
old
and
young
gentleman
out
of
the
house
,
beth
,
after
two
or
three
retreats
,
fairly
got
in
at
the
side
door
,
and
made
her
way
as
noiselessly
as
any
mouse
to
the
drawing
room
where
her
idol
stood
.
quite
by
accident
,
of
course
,
some
pretty
,
easy
music
lay
on
the
piano
,
and
with
trembling
fingers
and
frequent
stops
to
listen
and
look
about
,
beth
at
last
touched
the
great
instrument
,
and
straightway
forgot
her
fear
,
herself
,
and
everything
else
but
the
unspeakable
delight
which
the
music
gave
her
,
for
it
was
like
the
voice
of
a
beloved
friend
.
she
stayed
till
hannah
came
to
take
her
home
to
dinner
,
but
she
had
no
appetite
,
and
could
only
sit
and
smile
upon
everyone
in
a
general
state
of
beatitude
.
after
that
,
the
little
brown
hood
slipped
through
the
hedge
nearly
every
day
,
and
the
great
drawing
room
was
haunted
by
a
tuneful
spirit
that
came
and
went
unseen
.
she
never
knew
that
mr
.
laurence
opened
his
study
door
to
hear
the
old
fashioned
airs
he
liked
.
she
never
saw
laurie
mount
guard
in
the
hall
to
warn
the
servants
away
.
she
never
suspected
that
the
exercise
books
and
new
songs
which
she
found
in
the
rack
were
put
there
for
her
especial
benefit
,
and
when
he
talked
to
her
about
music
at
home
,
she
only
thought
how
kind
he
was
to
tell
things
that
helped
her
so
much
.
so
she
enjoyed
herself
heartily
,
and
found
,
what
isn
t
always
the
case
,
that
her
granted
wish
was
all
she
had
hoped
.
perhaps
it
was
because
she
was
so
grateful
for
this
blessing
that
a
greater
was
given
her
.
at
any
rate
she
deserved
both
.

mr

laurence
a
pair
of
slippers
.
he
is
so
kind
to
me
,
i
must
thank
him
,
and
i
don
t
know
any
other
way
.
can
i
do
it
?
asked
beth
,
a
few
weeks
after
that
eventful
call
of
his
.
yes
,
dear
.
it
will
please
him
very
much
,
and
be
a
nice
way
of
thanking
him
.
the
girls
will
help
you
about
them
,
and
i
will
pay
for
the
making
up
,
replied
mrs
.
march
,
who
took
peculiar
pleasure
in
granting
beth
s
requests
because
she
so
seldom
asked
anything
for
herself
.
after
many
serious
discussions
with
meg
and
jo
,
the
pattern
was
chosen
,
the
materials
bought
,
and
the
slippers
begun
.
a
cluster
of
grave
yet
cheerful
pansies
on
a
deeper
purple
ground
was
pronounced
very
appropriate
and
pretty
,
and
beth
worked
away
early
and
late
,
with
occasional
lifts
over
hard
parts
.
she
was
a
nimble
little
needlewoman
,
and
they
were
finished
before
anyone
got
tired
of
them
.
then
she
wrote
a
short
,
simple
note
,
and
with
laurie
s
help
,
got
them
smuggled
onto
the
study
table
one
morning
before
the
old
gentleman
was
up
.
when
this
excitement
was
over
,
beth
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
.
all
day
passed
and
a
part
of
the
next
before
any
acknowledgement
arrived
,
and
she
was
beginning
to
fear
she
had
offended
her
crochety
friend
.
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
,
she
went
out
to
do
an
errand
,
and
give
poor
joanna
,
the
invalid
doll
,
her
daily
exercise
.
as
she
came
up
the
street
,
on
her
return
,
she
saw
three
,
yes
,
four
heads
popping
in
and
out
of
the
parlor
windows
,
and
the
moment
they
saw
her
,
several
hands
were
waved
,
and
several
joyful
voices
screamed
...
here
s
a
letter
from
the
old
gentleman
!
come
quick
,
and
read
it
!
oh
,
beth
,
he
s
sent
you
...
began
amy
,
gesticulating
with
unseemly
energy
,
but
she
got
no
further
,
for
jo
quenched
her
by
slamming
down
the
window
.
beth
hurried
on
in
a
flutter
of
suspense
.
at
the
door
her
sisters
seized
and
bore
her
to
the
parlor
in
a
triumphal
procession
,
all
pointing
and
all
saying
at
once
,
look
there
!
look
there
!
beth
did
look
,
and
turned
pale
with
delight
and
surprise
,
for
there
stood
a
little
cabinet
piano
,
with
a
letter
lying
on
the
glossy
lid
,
directed
like
a
sign
board
to
miss
elizabeth
march
.
for
me
?
gasped
beth
,
holding
onto
jo
and
feeling
as
if
she
should
tumble
down
,
it
was
such
an
overwhelming
thing
altogether
.
yes
,
all
for
you
,
my
precious
!
isn
t
it
splendid
of
him
?
don
t
you
think
he
s
the
dearest
old
man
in
the
world
?
here
s
the
key
in
the
letter
.
we
didn
t
open
it
,
but
we
are
dying
to
know
what
he
says
,
cried
jo
,
hugging
her
sister
and
offering
the
note
.
you
read
it
!
i
can
t
,
i
feel
so
queer
!
oh
,
it
is
too
lovely
!
and
beth
hid
her
face
in
jo
s
apron
,
quite
upset
by
her
present
.
jo
opened
the
paper
and
began
to
laugh
,
for
the
first
words
she
saw
were
...
miss
march
dear
madam
how
nice
it
sounds
!
i
wish
someone
would
write
to
me
so
!
said
amy
,
who
thought
the
old
fashioned
address
very
elegant
.
i
have
had
many
pairs
of
slippers
in
my
life
,
but
i
never
had
any
that
suited
me
so
well
as
yours
,
continues
jo
.
heart
s
ease
is
my
favorite
flower
,
and
these
will
always
remind
me
of
the
gentle
giver
.
i
like
to
pay
my
debts
,
so
i
know
you
will
allow
the
old
gentleman
to
send
you
something
which
once
belonged
to
the
little
grand
daughter
he
lost
.
with
hearty
thanks
and
best
wishes
,
i
remain
your
grateful
friend
and
humble
servant
,
james
laurence
.
there
,
beth
,
that
s
an
honor
to
be
proud
of
,
i
m
sure
!
laurie
told
me
how
fond
mr
.
laurence
used
to
be
of
the
child
who
died
,
and
how
he
kept
all
her
little
things
carefully
.
just
think
,
he
s
given
you
her
piano
.
that
comes
of
having
big
blue
eyes
and
loving
music
,
said
jo
,
trying
to
soothe
beth
,
who
trembled
and
looked
more
excited
than
she
had
ever
been
before
.
see
the
cunning
brackets
to
hold
candles
,
and
the
nice
green
silk
,
puckered
up
,
with
a
gold
rose
in
the
middle
,
and
the
pretty
rack
and
stool
,
all
complete
,
added
meg
,
opening
the
instrument
and
displaying
its
beauties
.
your
humble
servant
,
james
laurence
.
only
think
of
his
writing
that
to
you
.
i
ll
tell
the
girls
.
they
ll
think
it
s
splendid
,
said
amy
,
much
impressed
by
the
note
.
try
it
,
honey
.
let
s
hear
the
sound
of
the
baby
pianny
,
said
hannah
,
who
always
took
a
share
in
the
family
joys
and
sorrows
.
so
beth
tried
it
,
and
everyone
pronounced
it
the
most
remarkable
piano
ever
heard
.
it
had
evidently
been
newly
tuned
and
put
in
apple
pie
order
,
but
,
perfect
as
it
was
,
i
think
the
real
charm
lay
in
the
happiest
of
all
happy
faces
which
leaned
over
it
,
as
beth
lovingly
touched
the
beautiful
black
and
white
keys
and
pressed
the
bright
pedals
.
you
ll
have
to
go
and
thank
him
,
said
jo
,
by
way
of
a
joke
,
for
the
idea
of
the
child
s
really
going
never
entered
her
head
.
yes
,
i
mean
to
.
i
guess
i
ll
go
now
,
before
i
get
frightened
thinking
about
it
.
and
,
to
the
utter
amazement
of
the
assembled
family
,
beth
walked
deliberately
down
the
garden
,
through
the
hedge
,
and
in
at
the
laurences
door
.
well
,
i
wish
i
may
die
if
it
ain
t
the
queerest
thing
i
ever
see
!
the
pianny
has
turned
her
head
!
she
d
never
have
gone
in
her
right
mind
,
cried
hannah
,
staring
after
her
,
while
the
girls
were
rendered
quite
speechless
by
the
miracle
.
they
would
have
been
still
more
amazed
if
they
had
seen
what
beth
did
afterward
.
if
you
will
believe
me
,
she
went
and
knocked
at
the
study
door
before
she
gave
herself
time
to
think
,
and
when
a
gruff
voice
called
out
,
come
in
!
she
did
go
in
,
right
up
to
mr
.
laurence
,
who
looked
quite
taken
aback
,
and
held
out
her
hand
,
saying
,
with
only
a
small
quaver
in
her
voice
,
i
came
to
thank
you
,
sir
,
for
...
but
she
didn
t
finish
,
for
he
looked
so
friendly
that
she
forgot
her
speech
and
,
only
remembering
that
he
had
lost
the
little
girl
he
loved
,
she
put
both
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
.
if
the
roof
of
the
house
had
suddenly
flown
off
,
the
old
gentleman
wouldn
t
have
been
more
astonished
.
but
he
liked
it
.
oh
,
dear
,
yes
,
he
liked
it
amazingly
!
and
was
so
touched
and
pleased
by
that
confiding
little
kiss
that
all
his
crustiness
vanished
,
and
he
just
set
her
on
his
knee
,
and
laid
his
wrinkled
cheek
against
her
rosy
one
,
feeling
as
if
he
had
got
his
own
little
granddaughter
back
again
.
beth
ceased
to
fear
him
from
that
moment
,
and
sat
there
talking
to
him
as
cozily
as
if
she
had
known
him
all
her
life
,
for
love
casts
out
fear
,
and
gratitude
can
conquer
pride
.
when
she
went
home
,
he
walked
with
her
to
her
own
gate
,
shook
hands
cordially
,
and
touched
his
hat
as
he
marched
back
again
,
looking
very
stately
and
erect
,
like
a
handsome
,
soldierly
old
gentleman
,
as
he
was
.
when
the
girls
saw
that
performance
,
jo
began
to
dance
a
jig
,
by
way
of
expressing
her
satisfaction
,
amy
nearly
fell
out
of
the
window
in
her
surprise
,
and
meg
exclaimed
,
with
up
lifted
hands
,
well
,
i
do
believe
the
world
is
coming
to
an
end
.
chapter
seven
amy
s
valley
of
humiliation
that
boy
is
a
perfect
cyclops
,
isn
t
he
?
said
amy
one
day
,
as
laurie
clattered
by
on
horseback
,
with
a
flourish
of
his
whip
as
he
passed
.
how
dare
you
say
so
,
when
he
s
got
both
his
eyes
?
and
very
handsome
ones
they
are
,
too
,
cried
jo
,
who
resented
any
slighting
remarks
about
her
friend
.
i
didn
t
say
anything
about
his
eyes
,
and
i
don
t
see
why
you
need
fire
up
when
i
admire
his
riding
.
oh
,
my
goodness
!
that
little
goose
means
a
centaur
,
and
she
called
him
a
cyclops
,
exclaimed
jo
,
with
a
burst
of
laughter
.
you
needn
t
be
so
rude
,
it
s
only
a
lapse
of
lingy
,
as
mr
.
davis
says
,
retorted
amy
,
finishing
jo
with
her
latin
.
i
just
wish
i
had
a
little
of
the
money
laurie
spends
on
that
horse
,
she
added
,
as
if
to
herself
,
yet
hoping
her
sisters
would
hear
.
why
?
asked
meg
kindly
,
for
jo
had
gone
off
in
another
laugh
at
amy
s
second
blunder
.
i
need
it
so
much
.
i
m
dreadfully
in
debt
,
and
it
won
t
be
my
turn
to
have
the
rag
money
for
a
month
.
in
debt
,
amy
?
what
do
you
mean
?
and
meg
looked
sober
.
why
,
i
owe
at
least
a
dozen
pickled
limes
,
and
i
can
t
pay
them
,
you
know
,
till
i
have
money
,
for
marmee
forbade
my
having
anything
charged
at
the
shop
.
tell
me
all
about
it
.
are
limes
the
fashion
now
?
it
used
to
be
pricking
bits
of
rubber
to
make
balls
.
and
meg
tried
to
keep
her
countenance
,
amy
looked
so
grave
and
important
.
why
,
you
see
,
the
girls
are
always
buying
them
,
and
unless
you
want
to
be
thought
mean
,
you
must
do
it
too
.
it
s
nothing
but
limes
now
,
for
everyone
is
sucking
them
in
their
desks
in
schooltime
,
and
trading
them
off
for
pencils
,
bead
rings
,
paper
dolls
,
or
something
else
,
at
recess
.
if
one
girl
likes
another
,
she
gives
her
a
lime
.
if
she
s
mad
with
her
,
she
eats
one
before
her
face
,
and
doesn
t
offer
even
a
suck
.
they
treat
by
turns
,
and
i
ve
had
ever
so
many
but
haven
t
returned
them
,
and
i
ought
for
they
are
debts
of
honor
,
you
know
.
how
much
will
pay
them
off
and
restore
your
credit
?
asked
meg
,
taking
out
her
purse
.
a
quarter
would
more
than
do
it
,
and
leave
a
few
cents
over
for
a
treat
for
you
.
don
t
you
like
limes
?
not
much
.
you
may
have
my
share
.
here
s
the
money
.
make
it
last
as
long
as
you
can
,
for
it
isn
t
very
plenty
,
you
know
.
oh
,
thank
you
!
it
must
be
so
nice
to
have
pocket
money
!
i
ll
have
a
grand
feast
,
for
i
haven
t
tasted
a
lime
this
week
.
i
felt
delicate
about
taking
any
,
as
i
couldn
t
return
them
,
and
i
m
actually
suffering
for
one
.
next
day
amy
was
rather
late
at
school
,
but
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
displaying
,
with
pardonable
pride
,
a
moist
brown
paper
parcel
,
before
she
consigned
it
to
the
inmost
recesses
of
her
desk
.
during
the
next
few
minutes
the
rumor
that
amy
march
had
got
twenty
four
delicious
limes
she
ate
one
on
the
way
and
was
going
to
treat
circulated
through
her
set
,
and
the
attentions
of
her
friends
became
quite
overwhelming
.
katy
brown
invited
her
to
her
next
party
on
the
spot
.
mary
kingsley
insisted
on
lending
her
her
watch
till
recess
,
and
jenny
snow
,
a
satirical
young
lady
,
who
had
basely
twitted
amy
upon
her
limeless
state
,
promptly
buried
the
hatchet
and
offered
to
furnish
answers
to
certain
appalling
sums
.
but
amy
had
not
forgotten
miss
snow
s
cutting
remarks
about
some
persons
whose
noses
were
not
too
flat
to
smell
other
people
s
limes
,
and
stuck
up
people
who
were
not
too
proud
to
ask
for
them
,
and
she
instantly
crushed
that
snow
girl
s
hopes
by
the
withering
telegram
,
you
needn
t
be
so
polite
all
of
a
sudden
,
for
you
won
t
get
any
.
a
distinguished
personage
happened
to
visit
the
school
that
morning
,
and
amy
s
beautifully
drawn
maps
received
praise
,
which
honor
to
her
foe
rankled
in
the
soul
of
miss
snow
,
and
caused
miss
march
to
assume
the
airs
of
a
studious
young
peacock
.
but
,
alas
,
alas
!
pride
goes
before
a
fall
,
and
the
revengeful
snow
turned
the
tables
with
disastrous
success
.
no
sooner
had
the
guest
paid
the
usual
stale
compliments
and
bowed
himself
out
,
than
jenny
,
under
pretense
of
asking
an
important
question
,
informed
mr
.
davis
,
the
teacher
,
that
amy
march
had
pickled
limes
in
her
desk
.
now
mr
.
davis
had
declared
limes
a
contraband
article
,
and
solemnly
vowed
to
publicly
ferrule
the
first
person
who
was
found
breaking
the
law
.
this
much
enduring
man
had
succeeded
in
banishing
chewing
gum
after
a
long
and
stormy
war
,
had
made
a
bonfire
of
the
confiscated
novels
and
newspapers
,
had
suppressed
a
private
post
office
,
had
forbidden
distortions
of
the
face
,
nicknames
,
and
caricatures
,
and
done
all
that
one
man
could
do
to
keep
half
a
hundred
rebellious
girls
in
order
.
boys
are
trying
enough
to
human
patience
,
goodness
knows
,
but
girls
are
infinitely
more
so
,
especially
to
nervous
gentlemen
with
tyrannical
tempers
and
no
more
talent
for
teaching
than
dr
.
blimber
.
mr
.
davis
knew
any
quantity
of
greek
,
latin
,
algebra
,
and
ologies
of
all
sorts
so
he
was
called
a
fine
teacher
,
and
manners
,
morals
,
feelings
,
and
examples
were
not
considered
of
any
particular
importance
.
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
moment
for
denouncing
amy
,
and
jenny
knew
it
.
mr
.
davis
had
evidently
taken
his
coffee
too
strong
that
morning
,
there
was
an
east
wind
,
which
always
affected
his
neuralgia
,
and
his
pupils
had
not
done
him
the
credit
which
he
felt
he
deserved
.
therefore
,
to
use
the
expressive
,
if
not
elegant
,
language
of
a
schoolgirl
,
he
was
as
nervous
as
a
witch
and
as
cross
as
a
bear
.
the
word
limes
was
like
fire
to
powder
,
his
yellow
face
flushed
,
and
he
rapped
on
his
desk
with
an
energy
which
made
jenny
skip
to
her
seat
with
unusual
rapidity
.
young
ladies
,
attention
,
if
you
please
!
at
the
stern
order
the
buzz
ceased
,
and
fifty
pairs
of
blue
,
black
,
gray
,
and
brown
eyes
were
obediently
fixed
upon
his
awful
countenance
.
miss
march
,
come
to
the
desk
.
amy
rose
to
comply
with
outward
composure
,
but
a
secret
fear
oppressed
her
,
for
the
limes
weighed
upon
her
conscience
.
bring
with
you
the
limes
you
have
in
your
desk
,
was
the
unexpected
command
which
arrested
her
before
she
got
out
of
her
seat
.
don
t
take
all
.
whispered
her
neighbor
,
a
young
lady
of
great
presence
of
mind
.
amy
hastily
shook
out
half
a
dozen
and
laid
the
rest
down
before
mr
.
davis
,
feeling
that
any
man
possessing
a
human
heart
would
relent
when
that
delicious
perfume
met
his
nose
.
unfortunately
,
mr
.
davis
particularly
detested
the
odor
of
the
fashionable
pickle
,
and
disgust
added
to
his
wrath
.
is
that
all
?
not
quite
,
stammered
amy
.
bring
the
rest
immediately
.
with
a
despairing
glance
at
her
set
,
she
obeyed
.
you
are
sure
there
are
no
more
?
i
never
lie
,
sir
.
so
i
see
.
now
take
these
disgusting
things
two
by
two
,
and
throw
them
out
of
the
window
.
there
was
a
simultaneous
sigh
,
which
created
quite
a
little
gust
,
as
the
last
hope
fled
,
and
the
treat
was
ravished
from
their
longing
lips
.
scarlet
with
shame
and
anger
,
amy
went
to
and
fro
six
dreadful
times
,
and
as
each
doomed
couple
,
looking
oh
,
so
plump
and
juicy
,
fell
from
her
reluctant
hands
,
a
shout
from
the
street
completed
the
anguish
of
the
girls
,
for
it
told
them
that
their
feast
was
being
exulted
over
by
the
little
irish
children
,
who
were
their
sworn
foes
.
this
this
was
too
much
.
all
flashed
indignant
or
appealing
glances
at
the
inexorable
davis
,
and
one
passionate
lime
lover
burst
into
tears
.
as
amy
returned
from
her
last
trip
,
mr
.
davis
gave
a
portentous
hem
!
and
said
,
in
his
most
impressive
manner
...
young
ladies
,
you
remember
what
i
said
to
you
a
week
ago
.
i
am
sorry
this
has
happened
,
but
i
never
allow
my
rules
to
be
infringed
,
and
i
never
break
my
word
.
miss
march
,
hold
out
your
hand
.
amy
started
,
and
put
both
hands
behind
her
,
turning
on
him
an
imploring
look
which
pleaded
for
her
better
than
the
words
she
could
not
utter
.
she
was
rather
a
favorite
with
old
davis
,
as
,
of
course
,
he
was
called
,
and
it
s
my
private
belief
that
he
would
have
broken
his
word
if
the
indignation
of
one
irrepressible
young
lady
had
not
found
vent
in
a
hiss
.
that
hiss
,
faint
as
it
was
,
irritated
the
irascible
gentleman
,
and
sealed
the
culprit
s
fate
.
your
hand
,
miss
march
!
was
the
only
answer
her
mute
appeal
received
,
and
too
proud
to
cry
or
beseech
,
amy
set
her
teeth
,
threw
back
her
head
defiantly
,
and
bore
without
flinching
several
tingling
blows
on
her
little
palm
.
they
were
neither
many
nor
heavy
,
but
that
made
no
difference
to
her
.
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
been
struck
,
and
the
disgrace
,
in
her
eyes
,
was
as
deep
as
if
he
had
knocked
her
down
.
you
will
now
stand
on
the
platform
till
recess
,
said
mr
.
davis
,
resolved
to
do
the
thing
thoroughly
,
since
he
had
begun
.
that
was
dreadful
.
it
would
have
been
bad
enough
to
go
to
her
seat
,
and
see
the
pitying
faces
of
her
friends
,
or
the
satisfied
ones
of
her
few
enemies
,
but
to
face
the
whole
school
,
with
that
shame
fresh
upon
her
,
seemed
impossible
,
and
for
a
second
she
felt
as
if
she
could
only
drop
down
where
she
stood
,
and
break
her
heart
with
crying
.
a
bitter
sense
of
wrong
and
the
thought
of
jenny
snow
helped
her
to
bear
it
,
and
,
taking
the
ignominious
place
,
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
stove
funnel
above
what
now
seemed
a
sea
of
faces
,
and
stood
there
,
so
motionless
and
white
that
the
girls
found
it
hard
to
study
with
that
pathetic
figure
before
them
.
during
the
fifteen
minutes
that
followed
,
the
proud
and
sensitive
little
girl
suffered
a
shame
and
pain
which
she
never
forgot
.
to
others
it
might
seem
a
ludicrous
or
trivial
affair
,
but
to
her
it
was
a
hard
experience
,
for
during
the
twelve
years
of
her
life
she
had
been
governed
by
love
alone
,
and
a
blow
of
that
sort
had
never
touched
her
before
.
the
smart
of
her
hand
and
the
ache
of
her
heart
were
forgotten
in
the
sting
of
the
thought
,
i
shall
have
to
tell
at
home
,
and
they
will
be
so
disappointed
in
me
!
the
fifteen
minutes
seemed
an
hour
,
but
they
came
to
an
end
at
last
,
and
the
word
recess
!
had
never
seemed
so
welcome
to
her
before
.
you
can
go
,
miss
march
,
said
mr
.
davis
,
looking
,
as
he
felt
,
uncomfortable
.
he
did
not
soon
forget
the
reproachful
glance
amy
gave
him
,
as
she
went
,
without
a
word
to
anyone
,
straight
into
the
anteroom
,
snatched
her
things
,
and
left
the
place
forever
,
as
she
passionately
declared
to
herself
.
she
was
in
a
sad
state
when
she
got
home
,
and
when
the
older
girls
arrived
,
some
time
later
,
an
indignation
meeting
was
held
at
once
.
mrs
.
march
did
not
say
much
but
looked
disturbed
,
and
comforted
her
afflicted
little
daughter
in
her
tenderest
manner
.
meg
bathed
the
insulted
hand
with
glycerine
and
tears
,
beth
felt
that
even
her
beloved
kittens
would
fail
as
a
balm
for
griefs
like
this
,
jo
wrathfully
proposed
that
mr
.
davis
be
arrested
without
delay
,
and
hannah
shook
her
fist
at
the
villain
and
pounded
potatoes
for
dinner
as
if
she
had
him
under
her
pestle
.
no
notice
was
taken
of
amy
s
flight
,
except
by
her
mates
,
but
the
sharp
eyed
demoiselles
discovered
that
mr
.
davis
was
quite
benignant
in
the
afternoon
,
also
unusually
nervous
.
just
before
school
closed
,
jo
appeared
,
wearing
a
grim
expression
as
she
stalked
up
to
the
desk
,
and
delivered
a
letter
from
her
mother
,
then
collected
amy
s
property
,
and
departed
,
carefully
scraping
the
mud
from
her
boots
on
the
door
mat
,
as
if
she
shook
the
dust
of
the
place
off
her
feet
.
yes
,
you
can
have
a
vacation
from
school
,
but
i
want
you
to
study
a
little
every
day
with
beth
,
said
mrs
.
march
that
evening
.
i
don
t
approve
of
corporal
punishment
,
especially
for
girls
.
i
dislike
mr
.
davis
s
manner
of
teaching
and
don
t
think
the
girls
you
associate
with
are
doing
you
any
good
,
so
i
shall
ask
your
father
s
advice
before
i
send
you
anywhere
else
.
that
s
good
!
i
wish
all
the
girls
would
leave
,
and
spoil
his
old
school
.
it
s
perfectly
maddening
to
think
of
those
lovely
limes
,
sighed
amy
,
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
.
i
am
not
sorry
you
lost
them
,
for
you
broke
the
rules
,
and
deserved
some
punishment
for
disobedience
,
was
the
severe
reply
,
which
rather
disappointed
the
young
lady
,
who
expected
nothing
but
sympathy
.
do
you
mean
you
are
glad
i
was
disgraced
before
the
whole
school
?
cried
amy
.
i
should
not
have
chosen
that
way
of
mending
a
fault
,
replied
her
mother
,
but
i
m
not
sure
that
it
won
t
do
you
more
good
than
a
bolder
method
.
you
are
getting
to
be
rather
conceited
,
my
dear
,
and
it
is
quite
time
you
set
about
correcting
it
.
you
have
a
good
many
little
gifts
and
virtues
,
but
there
is
no
need
of
parading
them
,
for
conceit
spoils
the
finest
genius
.
there
is
not
much
danger
that
real
talent
or
goodness
will
be
overlooked
long
,
even
if
it
is
,
the
consciousness
of
possessing
and
using
it
well
should
satisfy
one
,
and
the
great
charm
of
all
power
is
modesty
.
so
it
is
!
cried
laurie
,
who
was
playing
chess
in
a
corner
with
jo
.
i
knew
a
girl
once
,
who
had
a
really
remarkable
talent
for
music
,
and
she
didn
t
know
it
,
never
guessed
what
sweet
little
things
she
composed
when
she
was
alone
,
and
wouldn
t
have
believed
it
if
anyone
had
told
her
.
i
wish
i
d
known
that
nice
girl
.
maybe
she
would
have
helped
me
,
i
m
so
stupid
,
said
beth
,
who
stood
beside
him
,
listening
eagerly
.
you
do
know
her
,
and
she
helps
you
better
than
anyone
else
could
,
answered
laurie
,
looking
at
her
with
such
mischievous
meaning
in
his
merry
black
eyes
that
beth
suddenly
turned
very
red
,
and
hid
her
face
in
the
sofa
cushion
,
quite
overcome
by
such
an
unexpected
discovery
.
jo
let
laurie
win
the
game
to
pay
for
that
praise
of
her
beth
,
who
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
play
for
them
after
her
compliment
.
so
laurie
did
his
best
,
and
sang
delightfully
,
being
in
a
particularly
lively
humor
,
for
to
the
marches
he
seldom
showed
the
moody
side
of
his
character
.
when
he
was
gone
,
amy
,
who
had
been
pensive
all
evening
,
said
suddenly
,
as
if
busy
over
some
new
idea
,
is
laurie
an
accomplished
boy
?
yes
,
he
has
had
an
excellent
education
,
and
has
much
talent
.
he
will
make
a
fine
man
,
if
not
spoiled
by
petting
,
replied
her
mother
.
and
he
isn
t
conceited
,
is
he
?
asked
amy
.
not
in
the
least
.
that
is
why
he
is
so
charming
and
we
all
like
him
so
much
.
i
see
.
it
s
nice
to
have
accomplishments
and
be
elegant
,
but
not
to
show
off
or
get
perked
up
,
said
amy
thoughtfully
.
these
things
are
always
seen
and
felt
in
a
person
s
manner
and
conversations
,
if
modestly
used
,
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
display
them
,
said
mrs
.
march
.
any
more
than
it
s
proper
to
wear
all
your
bonnets
and
gowns
and
ribbons
at
once
,
that
folks
may
know
you
ve
got
them
,
added
jo
,
and
the
lecture
ended
in
a
laugh
.
chapter
eight
jo
meets
apollyon
girls
,
where
are
you
going
?
asked
amy
,
coming
into
their
room
one
saturday
afternoon
,
and
finding
them
getting
ready
to
go
out
with
an
air
of
secrecy
which
excited
her
curiosity
.
never
mind
.
little
girls
shouldn
t
ask
questions
,
returned
jo
sharply
.
now
if
there
is
anything
mortifying
to
our
feelings
when
we
are
young
,
it
is
to
be
told
that
,
and
to
be
bidden
to
run
away
,
dear
is
still
more
trying
to
us
.
amy
bridled
up
at
this
insult
,
and
determined
to
find
out
the
secret
,
if
she
teased
for
an
hour
.
turning
to
meg
,
who
never
refused
her
anything
very
long
,
she
said
coaxingly
,
do
tell
me
!
i
should
think
you
might
let
me
go
,
too
,
for
beth
is
fussing
over
her
piano
,
and
i
haven
t
got
anything
to
do
,
and
am
so
lonely
.
i
can
t
,
dear
,
because
you
aren
t
invited
,
began
meg
,
but
jo
broke
in
impatiently
,
now
,
meg
,
be
quiet
or
you
will
spoil
it
all
.
you
can
t
go
,
amy
,
so
don
t
be
a
baby
and
whine
about
it
.
you
are
going
somewhere
with
laurie
,
i
know
you
are
.
you
were
whispering
and
laughing
together
on
the
sofa
last
night
,
and
you
stopped
when
i
came
in
.
aren
t
you
going
with
him
?
yes
,
we
are
.
now
do
be
still
,
and
stop
bothering
.
amy
held
her
tongue
,
but
used
her
eyes
,
and
saw
meg
slip
a
fan
into
her
pocket
.
i
know
!
i
know
!
you
re
going
to
the
theater
to
see
the
seven
castles
!
she
cried
,
adding
resolutely
,
and
i
shall
go
,
for
mother
said
i
might
see
it
,
and
i
ve
got
my
rag
money
,
and
it
was
mean
not
to
tell
me
in
time
.
just
listen
to
me
a
minute
,
and
be
a
good
child
,
said
meg
soothingly
.
mother
doesn
t
wish
you
to
go
this
week
,
because
your
eyes
are
not
well
enough
yet
to
bear
the
light
of
this
fairy
piece
.
next
week
you
can
go
with
beth
and
hannah
,
and
have
a
nice
time
.
i
don
t
like
that
half
as
well
as
going
with
you
and
laurie
.
please
let
me
.
i
ve
been
sick
with
this
cold
so
long
,
and
shut
up
,
i
m
dying
for
some
fun
.
do
,
meg
!
i
ll
be
ever
so
good
,
pleaded
amy
,
looking
as
pathetic
as
she
could
.
suppose
we
take
her
.
i
don
t
believe
mother
would
mind
,
if
we
bundle
her
up
well
,
began
meg
.
if
she
goes
i
shan
t
,
and
if
i
don
t
,
laurie
won
t
like
it
,
and
it
will
be
very
rude
,
after
he
invited
only
us
,
to
go
and
drag
in
amy
.
i
should
think
she
d
hate
to
poke
herself
where
she
isn
t
wanted
,
said
jo
crossly
,
for
she
disliked
the
trouble
of
overseeing
a
fidgety
child
when
she
wanted
to
enjoy
herself
.
her
tone
and
manner
angered
amy
,
who
began
to
put
her
boots
on
,
saying
,
in
her
most
aggravating
way
,
i
shall
go
.
meg
says
i

anything
to
do
with
it
.
you
can
t
sit
with
us
,
for
our
seats
are
reserved
,
and
you
mustn
t
sit
alone
,
so
laurie
will
give
you
his
place
,
and
that
will
spoil
our
pleasure
.
or
he
ll
get
another
seat
for
you
,
and
that
isn
t
proper
when
you
weren
t
asked
.
you
shan
t
stir
a
step
,
so
you
may
just
stay
where
you
are
,
scolded
jo
,
crosser
than
ever
,
having
just
pricked
her
finger
in
her
hurry
.
sitting
on
the
floor
with
one
boot
on
,
amy
began
to
cry
and
meg
to
reason
with
her
,
when
laurie
called
from
below
,
and
the
two
girls
hurried
down
,
leaving
their
sister
wailing
.
for
now
and
then
she
forgot
her
grown
up
ways
and
acted
like
a
spoiled
child
.
just
as
the
party
was
setting
out
,
amy
called
over
the
banisters
in
a
threatening
tone
,
you
ll
be
sorry
for
this
,
jo
march
,
see
if
you
ain
t
.
fiddlesticks
!
returned
jo
,
slamming
the
door
.
they
had
a
charming
time
,
for
the
seven
castles
of
the
diamond
lake
was
as
brilliant
and
wonderful
as
heart
could
wish
.
but
in
spite
of
the
comical
red
imps
,
sparkling
elves
,
and
the
gorgeous
princes
and
princesses
,
jo
s
pleasure
had
a
drop
of
bitterness
in
it
.
the
fairy
queen
s
yellow
curls
reminded
her
of
amy
,
and
between
the
acts
she
amused
herself
with
wondering
what
her
sister
would
do
to
make
her
sorry
for
it
.
she
and
amy
had
had
many
lively
skirmishes
in
the
course
of
their
lives
,
for
both
had
quick
tempers
and
were
apt
to
be
violent
when
fairly
roused
.
amy
teased
jo
,
and
jo
irritated
amy
,
and
semioccasional
explosions
occurred
,
of
which
both
were
much
ashamed
afterward
.
although
the
oldest
,
jo
had
the
least
self
control
,
and
had
hard
times
trying
to
curb
the
fiery
spirit
which
was
continually
getting
her
into
trouble
.
her
anger
never
lasted
long
,
and
having
humbly
confessed
her
fault
,
she
sincerely
repented
and
tried
to
do
better
.
her
sisters
used
to
say
that
they
rather
liked
to
get
jo
into
a
fury
because
she
was
such
an
angel
afterward
.
poor
jo
tried
desperately
to
be
good
,
but
her
bosom
enemy
was
always
ready
to
flame
up
and
defeat
her
,
and
it
took
years
of
patient
effort
to
subdue
it
.
when
they
got
home
,
they
found
amy
reading
in
the
parlor
.
she
assumed
an
injured
air
as
they
came
in
,
never
lifted
her
eyes
from
her
book
,
or
asked
a
single
question
.
perhaps
curiosity
might
have
conquered
resentment
,
if
beth
had
not
been
there
to
inquire
and
receive
a
glowing
description
of
the
play
.
on
going
up
to
put
away
her
best
hat
,
jo
s
first
look
was
toward
the
bureau
,
for
in
their
last
quarrel
amy
had
soothed
her
feelings
by
turning
jo
s
top
drawer
upside
down
on
the
floor
.
everything
was
in
its
place
,
however
,
and
after
a
hasty
glance
into
her
various
closets
,
bags
,
and
boxes
,
jo
decided
that
amy
had
forgiven
and
forgotten
her
wrongs
.
there
jo
was
mistaken
,
for
next
day
she
made
a
discovery
which
produced
a
tempest
.
meg
,
beth
,
and
amy
were
sitting
together
,
late
in
the
afternoon
,
when
jo
burst
into
the
room
,
looking
excited
and
demanding
breathlessly
,
has
anyone
taken
my
book
?
meg
and
beth
said
,
no
.
at
once
,
and
looked
surprised
.
amy
poked
the
fire
and
said
nothing
.
jo
saw
her
color
rise
and
was
down
upon
her
in
a
minute
.
amy
,
you
ve
got
it
!
no
,
i
haven
t
.
you
know
where
it
is
,
then
!
no
,
i
don
t
.
that
s
a
fib
!
cried
jo
,
taking
her
by
the
shoulders
,
and
looking
fierce
enough
to
frighten
a
much
braver
child
than
amy
.
it
isn
t
.
i
haven
t
got
it
,
don
t
know
where
it
is
now
,
and
don
t
care
.
you
know
something
about
it
,
and
you
d
better
tell
at
once
,
or
i
ll
make
you
.
and
jo
gave
her
a
slight
shake
.
scold
as
much
as
you
like
,
you
ll
never
see
your
silly
old
book
again
,
cried
amy
,
getting
excited
in
her
turn
.
why
not
?
i
burned
it
up
.
what
!
my
little
book
i
was
so
fond
of
,
and
worked
over
,
and
meant
to
finish
before
father
got
home
?
have
you
really
burned
it
?
said
jo
,
turning
very
pale
,
while
her
eyes
kindled
and
her
hands
clutched
amy
nervously
.
yes
,
i
did
!
i
told
you
i
d
make
you
pay
for
being
so
cross
yesterday
,
and
i
have
,
so
...
amy
got
no
farther
,
for
jo
s
hot
temper
mastered
her
,
and
she
shook
amy
till
her
teeth
chattered
in
her
head
,
crying
in
a
passion
of
grief
and
anger
...
you
wicked
,
wicked
girl
!
i
never
can
write
it
again
,
and
i
ll
never
forgive
you
as
long
as
i
live
.
meg
flew
to
rescue
amy
,
and
beth
to
pacify
jo
,
but
jo
was
quite
beside
herself
,
and
with
a
parting
box
on
her
sister
s
ear
,
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
up
to
the
old
sofa
in
the
garret
,
and
finished
her
fight
alone
.
the
storm
cleared
up
below
,
for
mrs
.
march
came
home
,
and
,
having
heard
the
story
,
soon
brought
amy
to
a
sense
of
the
wrong
she
had
done
her
sister
.
jo
s
book
was
the
pride
of
her
heart
,
and
was
regarded
by
her
family
as
a
literary
sprout
of
great
promise
.
it
was
only
half
a
dozen
little
fairy
tales
,
but
jo
had
worked
over
them
patiently
,
putting
her
whole
heart
into
her
work
,
hoping
to
make
something
good
enough
to
print
.
she
had
just
copied
them
with
great
care
,
and
had
destroyed
the
old
manuscript
,
so
that
amy
s
bonfire
had
consumed
the
loving
work
of
several
years
.
it
seemed
a
small
loss
to
others
,
but
to
jo
it
was
a
dreadful
calamity
,
and
she
felt
that
it
never
could
be
made
up
to
her
.
beth
mourned
as
for
a
departed
kitten
,
and
meg
refused
to
defend
her
pet
.
mrs
.
march
looked
grave
and
grieved
,
and
amy
felt
that
no
one
would
love
her
till
she
had
asked
pardon
for
the
act
which
she
now
regretted
more
than
any
of
them
.
when
the
tea
bell
rang
,
jo
appeared
,
looking
so
grim
and
unapproachable
that
it
took
all
amy
s
courage
to
say
meekly
...
please
forgive
me
,
jo
.
i
m
very
,
very
sorry
.
i
never
shall
forgive
you
,
was
jo
s
stern
answer
,
and
from
that
moment
she
ignored
amy
entirely
.
no
one
spoke
of
the
great
trouble
,
not
even
mrs
.
march
,
for
all
had
learned
by
experience
that
when
jo
was
in
that
mood
words
were
wasted
,
and
the
wisest
course
was
to
wait
till
some
little
accident
,
or
her
own
generous
nature
,
softened
jo
s
resentment
and
healed
the
breach
.
it
was
not
a
happy
evening
,
for
though
they
sewed
as
usual
,
while
their
mother
read
aloud
from
bremer
,
scott
,
or
edgeworth
,
something
was
wanting
,
and
the
sweet
home
peace
was
disturbed
.
they
felt
this
most
when
singing
time
came
,
for
beth
could
only
play
,
jo
stood
dumb
as
a
stone
,
and
amy
broke
down
,
so
meg
and
mother
sang
alone
.
but
in
spite
of
their
efforts
to
be
as
cheery
as
larks
,
the
flutelike
voices
did
not
seem
to
chord
as
well
as
usual
,
and
all
felt
out
of
tune
.
as
jo
received
her
good
night
kiss
,
mrs
.
march
whispered
gently
,
my
dear
,
don
t
let
the
sun
go
down
upon
your
anger
.
forgive
each
other
,
help
each
other
,
and
begin
again
tomorrow
.
jo
wanted
to
lay
her
head
down
on
that
motherly
bosom
,
and
cry
her
grief
and
anger
all
away
,
but
tears
were
an
unmanly
weakness
,
and
she
felt
so
deeply
injured
that
she
really
couldn
t
quite
forgive
yet
.
so
she
winked
hard
,
shook
her
head
,
and
said
gruffly
because
amy
was
listening
,
it
was
an
abominable
thing
,
and
she
doesn
t
deserve
to
be
forgiven
.
with
that
she
marched
off
to
bed
,
and
there
was
no
merry
or
confidential
gossip
that
night
.
amy
was
much
offended
that
her
overtures
of
peace
had
been
repulsed
,
and
began
to
wish
she
had
not
humbled
herself
,
to
feel
more
injured
than
ever
,
and
to
plume
herself
on
her
superior
virtue
in
a
way
which
was
particularly
exasperating
.
jo
still
looked
like
a
thunder
cloud
,
and
nothing
went
well
all
day
.
it
was
bitter
cold
in
the
morning
,
she
dropped
her
precious
turnover
in
the
gutter
,
aunt
march
had
an
attack
of
the
fidgets
,
meg
was
sensitive
,
beth
would
look
grieved
and
wistful
when
she
got
home
,
and
amy
kept
making
remarks
about
people
who
were
always
talking
about
being
good
and
yet
wouldn
t
even
try
when
other
people
set
them
a
virtuous
example
.
everybody
is
so
hateful
,
i
ll
ask
laurie
to
go
skating
.
he
is
always
kind
and
jolly
,
and
will
put
me
to
rights
,
i
know
,
said
jo
to
herself
,
and
off
she
went
.
amy
heard
the
clash
of
skates
,
and
looked
out
with
an
impatient
exclamation
.
there
!
she
promised
i
should
go
next
time
,
for
this
is
the
last
ice
we
shall
have
.
but
it
s
no
use
to
ask
such
a
crosspatch
to
take
me
.
don
t
say
that
.
you
were
very
naughty
,
and
it
is
hard
to
forgive
the
loss
of
her
precious
little
book
,
but
i
think
she
might
do
it
now
,
and
i
guess
she
will
,
if
you
try
her
at
the
right
minute
,
said
meg
.
go
after
them
.
don
t
say
anything
till
jo
has
got
good
natured
with
laurie
,
than
take
a
quiet
minute
and
just
kiss
her
,
or
do
some
kind
thing
,
and
i
m
sure
she
ll
be
friends
again
with
all
her
heart
.
i
ll
try
,
said
amy
,
for
the
advice
suited
her
,
and
after
a
flurry
to
get
ready
,
she
ran
after
the
friends
,
who
were
just
disappearing
over
the
hill
.
it
was
not
far
to
the
river
,
but
both
were
ready
before
amy
reached
them
.
jo
saw
her
coming
,
and
turned
her
back
.
laurie
did
not
see
,
for
he
was
carefully
skating
along
the
shore
,
sounding
the
ice
,
for
a
warm
spell
had
preceded
the
cold
snap
.
i
ll
go
on
to
the
first
bend
,
and
see
if
it
s
all
right
before
we
begin
to
race
,
amy
heard
him
say
,
as
he
shot
away
,
looking
like
a
young
russian
in
his
fur
trimmed
coat
and
cap
.
jo
heard
amy
panting
after
her
run
,
stamping
her
feet
and
blowing
on
her
fingers
as
she
tried
to
put
her
skates
on
,
but
jo
never
turned
and
went
slowly
zigzagging
down
the
river
,
taking
a
bitter
,
unhappy
sort
of
satisfaction
in
her
sister
s
troubles
.
she
had
cherished
her
anger
till
it
grew
strong
and
took
possession
of
her
,
as
evil
thoughts
and
feelings
always
do
unless
cast
out
at
once
.
as
laurie
turned
the
bend
,
he
shouted
back
...
keep
near
the
shore
.
it
isn
t
safe
in
the
middle
.
jo
heard
,
but
amy
was
struggling
to
her
feet
and
did
not
catch
a
word
.
jo
glanced
over
her
shoulder
,
and
the
little
demon
she
was
harboring
said
in
her
ear
...
no
matter
whether
she
heard
or
not
,
let
her
take
care
of
herself
.
laurie
had
vanished
round
the
bend
,
jo
was
just
at
the
turn
,
and
amy
,
far
behind
,
striking
out
toward
the
smoother
ice
in
the
middle
of
the
river
.
for
a
minute
jo
stood
still
with
a
strange
feeling
in
her
heart
,
then
she
resolved
to
go
on
,
but
something
held
and
turned
her
round
,
just
in
time
to
see
amy
throw
up
her
hands
and
go
down
,
with
a
sudden
crash
of
rotten
ice
,
the
splash
of
water
,
and
a
cry
that
made
jo
s
heart
stand
still
with
fear
.
she
tried
to
call
laurie
,
but
her
voice
was
gone
.
she
tried
to
rush
forward
,
but
her
feet
seemed
to
have
no
strength
in
them
,
and
for
a
second
,
she
could
only
stand
motionless
,
staring
with
a
terror
stricken
face
at
the
little
blue
hood
above
the
black
water
.
something
rushed
swiftly
by
her
,
and
laurie
s
voice
cried
out
...
bring
a
rail
.
quick
,
quick
!
how
she
did
it
,
she
never
knew
,
but
for
the
next
few
minutes
she
worked
as
if
possessed
,
blindly
obeying
laurie
,
who
was
quite
self
possessed
,
and
lying
flat
,
held
amy
up
by
his
arm
and
hockey
stick
till
jo
dragged
a
rail
from
the
fence
,
and
together
they
got
the
child
out
,
more
frightened
than
hurt
.
now
then
,
we
must
walk
her
home
as
fast
as
we
can
.
pile
our
things
on
her
,
while
i
get
off
these
confounded
skates
,
cried
laurie
,
wrapping
his
coat
round
amy
,
and
tugging
away
at
the
straps
which
never
seemed
so
intricate
before
.
shivering
,
dripping
,
and
crying
,
they
got
amy
home
,
and
after
an
exciting
time
of
it
,
she
fell
asleep
,
rolled
in
blankets
before
a
hot
fire
.
during
the
bustle
jo
had
scarcely
spoken
but
flown
about
,
looking
pale
and
wild
,
with
her
things
half
off
,
her
dress
torn
,
and
her
hands
cut
and
bruised
by
ice
and
rails
and
refractory
buckles
.
when
amy
was
comfortably
asleep
,
the
house
quiet
,
and
mrs
.
march
sitting
by
the
bed
,
she
called
jo
to
her
and
began
to
bind
up
the
hurt
hands
.
are
you
sure
she
is
safe
?
whispered
jo
,
looking
remorsefully
at
the
golden
head
,
which
might
have
been
swept
away
from
her
sight
forever
under
the
treacherous
ice
.
quite
safe
,
dear
.
she
is
not
hurt
,
and
won
t
even
take
cold
,
i
think
,
you
were
so
sensible
in
covering
and
getting
her
home
quickly
,
replied
her
mother
cheerfully
.
laurie
did
it
all
.
i
only
let
her
go
.
mother
,
if
she
should
die
,
it
would
be
my
fault
.
and
jo
dropped
down
beside
the
bed
in
a
passion
of
penitent
tears
,
telling
all
that
had
happened
,
bitterly
condemning
her
hardness
of
heart
,
and
sobbing
out
her
gratitude
for
being
spared
the
heavy
punishment
which
might
have
come
upon
her
.
it
s
my
dreadful
temper
!
i
try
to
cure
it
,
i
think
i
have
,
and
then
it
breaks
out
worse
than
ever
.
oh
,
mother
,
what
shall
i
do
?
what
shall
i
do
?
cried
poor
jo
,
in
despair
.
watch
and
pray
,
dear
,
never
get
tired
of
trying
,
and
never
think
it
is
impossible
to
conquer
your
fault
,
said
mrs
.
march
,
drawing
the
blowzy
head
to
her
shoulder
and
kissing
the
wet
cheek
so
tenderly
that
jo
cried
even
harder
.
you
don
t
know
,
you
can
t
guess
how
bad
it
is
!
it
seems
as
if
i
could
do
anything
when
i
m
in
a
passion
.
i
get
so
savage
,
i
could
hurt
anyone
and
enjoy
it
.
i
m
afraid
i
shall
do
something
dreadful
some
day
,
and
spoil
my
life
,
and
make
everybody
hate
me
.
oh
,
mother
,
help
me
,
do
help
me
!
i
will
,
my
child
,
i
will
.
don
t
cry
so
bitterly
,
but
remember
this
day
,
and
resolve
with
all
your
soul
that
you
will
never
know
another
like
it
.
jo
,
dear
,
we
all
have
our
temptations
,
some
far
greater
than
yours
,
and
it
often
takes
us
all
our
lives
to
conquer
them
.
you
think
your
temper
is
the
worst
in
the
world
,
but
mine
used
to
be
just
like
it
.
yours
,
mother
?
why
,
you
are
never
angry
!
and
for
the
moment
jo
forgot
remorse
in
surprise
.
i
ve
been
trying
to
cure
it
for
forty
years
,
and
have
only
succeeded
in
controlling
it
.
i
am
angry
nearly
every
day
of
my
life
,
jo
,
but
i
have
learned
not
to
show
it
,
and
i
still
hope
to
learn
not
to
feel
it
,
though
it
may
take
me
another
forty
years
to
do
so
.
the
patience
and
the
humility
of
the
face
she
loved
so
well
was
a
better
lesson
to
jo
than
the
wisest
lecture
,
the
sharpest
reproof
.
she
felt
comforted
at
once
by
the
sympathy
and
confidence
given
her
.
the
knowledge
that
her
mother
had
a
fault
like
hers
,
and
tried
to
mend
it
,
made
her
own
easier
to
bear
and
strengthened
her
resolution
to
cure
it
,
though
forty
years
seemed
rather
a
long
time
to
watch
and
pray
to
a
girl
of
fifteen
.
mother
,
are
you
angry
when
you
fold
your
lips
tight
together
and
go
out
of
the
room
sometimes
,
when
aunt
march
scolds
or
people
worry
you
?
asked
jo
,
feeling
nearer
and
dearer
to
her
mother
than
ever
before
.
yes
,
i
ve
learned
to
check
the
hasty
words
that
rise
to
my
lips
,
and
when
i
feel
that
they
mean
to
break
out
against
my
will
,
i
just
go
away
for
a
minute
,
and
give
myself
a
little
shake
for
being
so
weak
and
wicked
,
answered
mrs
.
march
with
a
sigh
and
a
smile
,
as
she
smoothed
and
fastened
up
jo
s
disheveled
hair
.
how
did
you
learn
to
keep
still
?
that
is
what
troubles
me
,
for
the
sharp
words
fly
out
before
i
know
what
i
m
about
,
and
the
more
i
say
the
worse
i
get
,
till
it
s
a
pleasure
to
hurt
people
s
feelings
and
say
dreadful
things
.
tell
me
how
you
do
it
,
marmee
dear
.
my
good
mother
used
to
help
me
...
as
you
do
us
...
interrupted
jo
,
with
a
grateful
kiss
.
but
i
lost
her
when
i
was
a
little
older
than
you
are
,
and
for
years
had
to
struggle
on
alone
,
for
i
was
too
proud
to
confess
my
weakness
to
anyone
else
.
i
had
a
hard
time
,
jo
,
and
shed
a
good
many
bitter
tears
over
my
failures
,
for
in
spite
of
my
efforts
i
never
seemed
to
get
on
.
then
your
father
came
,
and
i
was
so
happy
that
i
found
it
easy
to
be
good
.
but
by
and
by
,
when
i
had
four
little
daughters
round
me
and
we
were
poor
,
then
the
old
trouble
began
again
,
for
i
am
not
patient
by
nature
,
and
it
tried
me
very
much
to
see
my
children
wanting
anything
.
poor
mother
!
what
helped
you
then
?
your
father
,
jo
.
he
never
loses
patience
,
never
doubts
or
complains
,
but
always
hopes
,
and
works
and
waits
so
cheerfully
that
one
is
ashamed
to
do
otherwise
before
him
.
he
helped
and
comforted
me
,
and
showed
me
that
i
must
try
to
practice
all
the
virtues
i
would
have
my
little
girls
possess
,
for
i
was
their
example
.
it
was
easier
to
try
for
your
sakes
than
for
my
own
.
a
startled
or
surprised
look
from
one
of
you
when
i
spoke
sharply
rebuked
me
more
than
any
words
could
have
done
,
and
the
love
,
respect
,
and
confidence
of
my
children
was
the
sweetest
reward
i
could
receive
for
my
efforts
to
be
the
woman
i
would
have
them
copy
.
oh
,
mother
,
if
i
m
ever
half
as
good
as
you
,
i
shall
be
satisfied
,
cried
jo
,
much
touched
.
i
hope
you
will
be
a
great
deal
better
,
dear
,
but
you
must
keep
watch
over
your
bosom
enemy
,
as
father
calls
it
,
or
it
may
sadden
,
if
not
spoil
your
life
.
you
have
had
a
warning
.
remember
it
,
and
try
with
heart
and
soul
to
master
this
quick
temper
,
before
it
brings
you
greater
sorrow
and
regret
than
you
have
known
today
.
i
will
try
,
mother
,
i
truly
will
.
but
you
must
help
me
,
remind
me
,
and
keep
me
from
flying
out
.
i
used
to
see
father
sometimes
put
his
finger
on
his
lips
,
and
look
at
you
with
a
very
kind
but
sober
face
,
and
you
always
folded
your
lips
tight
and
went
away
.
was
he
reminding
you
then
?
asked
jo
softly
.
yes
.
i
asked
him
to
help
me
so
,
and
he
never
forgot
it
,
but
saved
me
from
many
a
sharp
word
by
that
little
gesture
and
kind
look
.
jo
saw
that
her
mother
s
eyes
filled
and
her
lips
trembled
as
she
spoke
,
and
fearing
that
she
had
said
too
much
,
she
whispered
anxiously
,
was
it
wrong
to
watch
you
and
to
speak
of
it
?
i
didn
t
mean
to
be
rude
,
but
it
s
so
comfortable
to
say
all
i
think
to
you
,
and
feel
so
safe
and
happy
here
.
my
jo
,
you
may
say
anything
to
your
mother
,
for
it
is
my
greatest
happiness
and
pride
to
feel
that
my
girls
confide
in
me
and
know
how
much
i
love
them
.
i
thought
i
d
grieved
you
.
no
,
dear
,
but
speaking
of
father
reminded
me
how
much
i
miss
him
,
how
much
i
owe
him
,
and
how
faithfully
i
should
watch
and
work
to
keep
his
little
daughters
safe
and
good
for
him
.
yet
you
told
him
to
go
,
mother
,
and
didn
t
cry
when
he
went
,
and
never
complain
now
,
or
seem
as
if
you
needed
any
help
,
said
jo
,
wondering
.
i
gave
my
best
to
the
country
i
love
,
and
kept
my
tears
till
he
was
gone
.
why
should
i
complain
,
when
we
both
have
merely
done
our
duty
and
will
surely
be
the
happier
for
it
in
the
end
?
if
i
don
t
seem
to
need
help
,
it
is
because
i
have
a
better
friend
,
even
than
father
,
to
comfort
and
sustain
me
.
my
child
,
the
troubles
and
temptations
of
your
life
are
beginning
and
may
be
many
,
but
you
can
overcome
and
outlive
them
all
if
you
learn
to
feel
the
strength
and
tenderness
of
your
heavenly
father
as
you
do
that
of
your
earthly
one
.
the
more
you
love
and
trust
him
,
the
nearer
you
will
feel
to
him
,
and
the
less
you
will
depend
on
human
power
and
wisdom
.
his
love
and
care
never
tire
or
change
,
can
never
be
taken
from
you
,
but
may
become
the
source
of
lifelong
peace
,
happiness
,
and
strength
.
believe
this
heartily
,
and
go
to
god
with
all
your
little
cares
,
and
hopes
,
and
sins
,
and
sorrows
,
as
freely
and
confidingly
as
you
come
to
your
mother
.
jo
s
only
answer
was
to
hold
her
mother
close
,
and
in
the
silence
which
followed
the
sincerest
prayer
she
had
ever
prayed
left
her
heart
without
words
.
for
in
that
sad
yet
happy
hour
,
she
had
learned
not
only
the
bitterness
of
remorse
and
despair
,
but
the
sweetness
of
self
denial
and
self
control
,
and
led
by
her
mother
s
hand
,
she
had
drawn
nearer
to
the
friend
who
always
welcomes
every
child
with
a
love
stronger
than
that
of
any
father
,
tenderer
than
that
of
any
mother
.
amy
stirred
and
sighed
in
her
sleep
,
and
as
if
eager
to
begin
at
once
to
mend
her
fault
,
jo
looked
up
with
an
expression
on
her
face
which
it
had
never
worn
before
.
i
let
the
sun
go
down
on
my
anger
.
i
wouldn
t
forgive
her
,
and
today
,
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
laurie
,
it
might
have
been
too
late
!
how
could
i
be
so
wicked
?
said
jo
,
half
aloud
,
as
she
leaned
over
her
sister
softly
stroking
the
wet
hair
scattered
on
the
pillow
.
as
if
she
heard
,
amy
opened
her
eyes
,
and
held
out
her
arms
,
with
a
smile
that
went
straight
to
jo
s
heart
.
neither
said
a
word
,
but
they
hugged
one
another
close
,
in
spite
of
the
blankets
,
and
everything
was
forgiven
and
forgotten
in
one
hearty
kiss
.
chapter
nine
meg
goes
to
vanity
fair
i
do
think
it
was
the
most
fortunate
thing
in
the
world
that
those
children
should
have
the
measles
just
now
,
said
meg
,
one
april
day
,
as
she
stood
packing
the
go
abroady
trunk
in
her
room
,
surrounded
by
her
sisters
.
and
so
nice
of
annie
moffat
not
to
forget
her
promise
.
a
whole
fortnight
of
fun
will
be
regularly
splendid
,
replied
jo
,
looking
like
a
windmill
as
she
folded
skirts
with
her
long
arms
.
and
such
lovely
weather
,
i
m
so
glad
of
that
,
added
beth
,
tidily
sorting
neck
and
hair
ribbons
in
her
best
box
,
lent
for
the
great
occasion
.
i
wish
i
was
going
to
have
a
fine
time
and
wear
all
these
nice
things
,
said
amy
with
her
mouth
full
of
pins
,
as
she
artistically
replenished
her
sister
s
cushion
.
i
wish
you
were
all
going
,
but
as
you
can
t
,
i
shall
keep
my
adventures
to
tell
you
when
i
come
back
.
i
m
sure
it
s
the
least
i
can
do
when
you
have
been
so
kind
,
lending
me
things
and
helping
me
get
ready
,
said
meg
,
glancing
round
the
room
at
the
very
simple
outfit
,
which
seemed
nearly
perfect
in
their
eyes
.
what
did
mother
give
you
out
of
the
treasure
box
?
asked
amy
,
who
had
not
been
present
at
the
opening
of
a
certain
cedar
chest
in
which
mrs
.
march
kept
a
few
relics
of
past
splendor
,
as
gifts
for
her
girls
when
the
proper
time
came
.
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
,
that
pretty
carved
fan
,
and
a
lovely
blue
sash
.
i
wanted
the
violet
silk
,
but
there
isn
t
time
to
make
it
over
,
so
i
must
be
contented
with
my
old
tarlaton
.
it
will
look
nice
over
my
new
muslin
skirt
,
and
the
sash
will
set
it
off
beautifully
.
i
wish
i
hadn
t
smashed
my
coral
bracelet
,
for
you
might
have
had
it
,
said
jo
,
who
loved
to
give
and
lend
,
but
whose
possessions
were
usually
too
dilapidated
to
be
of
much
use
.
there
is
a
lovely
old
fashioned
pearl
set
in
the
treasure
chest
,
but
mother
said
real
flowers
were
the
prettiest
ornament
for
a
young
girl
,
and
laurie
promised
to
send
me
all
i
want
,
replied
meg
.
now
,
let
me
see
,
there
s
my
new
gray
walking
suit
,
just
curl
up
the
feather
in
my
hat
,
beth
,
then
my
poplin
for
sunday
and
the
small
party
,
it
looks
heavy
for
spring
,
doesn
t
it
?
the
violet
silk
would
be
so
nice
.
oh
,
dear
!
never
mind
,
you
ve
got
the
tarlaton
for
the
big
party
,
and
you
always
look
like
an
angel
in
white
,
said
amy
,
brooding
over
the
little
store
of
finery
in
which
her
soul
delighted
.
it
isn
t
low
necked
,
and
it
doesn
t
sweep
enough
,
but
it
will
have
to
do
.
my
blue
housedress
looks
so
well
,
turned
and
freshly
trimmed
,
that
i
feel
as
if
i
d
got
a
new
one
.
my
silk
sacque
isn
t
a
bit
the
fashion
,
and
my
bonnet
doesn
t
look
like
sallie
s
.
i
didn
t
like
to
say
anything
,
but
i
was
sadly
disappointed
in
my
umbrella
.
i
told
mother
black
with
a
white
handle
,
but
she
forgot
and
bought
a
green
one
with
a
yellowish
handle
.
it
s
strong
and
neat
,
so
i
ought
not
to
complain
,
but
i
know
i
shall
feel
ashamed
of
it
beside
annie
s
silk
one
with
a
gold
top
,
sighed
meg
,
surveying
the
little
umbrella
with
great
disfavor
.
change
it
,
advised
jo
.
i
won
t
be
so
silly
,
or
hurt
marmee
s
feelings
,
when
she
took
so
much
pains
to
get
my
things
.
it
s
a
nonsensical
notion
of
mine
,
and
i
m
not
going
to
give
up
to
it
.
my
silk
stockings
and
two
pairs
of
new
gloves
are
my
comfort
.
you
are
a
dear
to
lend
me
yours
,
jo
.
i
feel
so
rich
and
sort
of
elegant
,
with
two
new
pairs
,
and
the
old
ones
cleaned
up
for
common
.
and
meg
took
a
refreshing
peep
at
her
glove
box
.
annie
moffat
has
blue
and
pink
bows
on
her
nightcaps
.
would
you
put
some
on
mine
?
she
asked
,
as
beth
brought
up
a
pile
of
snowy
muslins
,
fresh
from
hannah
s
hands
.
no
,
i
wouldn
t
,
for
the
smart
caps
won
t
match
the
plain
gowns
without
any
trimming
on
them
.
poor
folks
shouldn
t
rig
,
said
jo
decidedly
.
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
be
happy
enough
to
have
real
lace
on
my
clothes
and
bows
on
my
caps
?
said
meg
impatiently
.
you
said
the
other
day
that
you
d
be
perfectly
happy
if
you
could
only
go
to
annie
moffat
s
,
observed
beth
in
her
quiet
way
.
so
i
did
!
well
,
i
am
happy
,
and
i
won
t
fret
,
but
it
does
seem
as
if
the
more
one
gets
the
more
one
wants
,
doesn
t
it
?
there
now
,
the
trays
are
ready
,
and
everything
in
but
my
ball
dress
,
which
i
shall
leave
for
mother
to
pack
,
said
meg
,
cheering
up
,
as
she
glanced
from
the
half
filled
trunk
to
the
many
times
pressed
and
mended
white
tarlaton
,
which
she
called
her
ball
dress
with
an
important
air
.
the
next
day
was
fine
,
and
meg
departed
in
style
for
a
fortnight
of
novelty
and
pleasure
.
mrs
.
march
had
consented
to
the
visit
rather
reluctantly
,
fearing
that
margaret
would
come
back
more
discontented
than
she
went
.
but
she
begged
so
hard
,
and
sallie
had
promised
to
take
good
care
of
her
,
and
a
little
pleasure
seemed
so
delightful
after
a
winter
of
irksome
work
that
the
mother
yielded
,
and
the
daughter
went
to
take
her
first
taste
of
fashionable
life
.
the
moffats
were
very
fashionable
,
and
simple
meg
was
rather
daunted
,
at
first
,
by
the
splendor
of
the
house
and
the
elegance
of
its
occupants
.
but
they
were
kindly
people
,
in
spite
of
the
frivolous
life
they
led
,
and
soon
put
their
guest
at
her
ease
.
perhaps
meg
felt
,
without
understanding
why
,
that
they
were
not
particularly
cultivated
or
intelligent
people
,
and
that
all
their
gilding
could
not
quite
conceal
the
ordinary
material
of
which
they
were
made
.
it
certainly
was
agreeable
to
fare
sumptuously
,
drive
in
a
fine
carriage
,
wear
her
best
frock
every
day
,
and
do
nothing
but
enjoy
herself
.
it
suited
her
exactly
,
and
soon
she
began
to
imitate
the
manners
and
conversation
of
those
about
her
,
to
put
on
little
airs
and
graces
,
use
french
phrases
,
crimp
her
hair
,
take
in
her
dresses
,
and
talk
about
the
fashions
as
well
as
she
could
.
the
more
she
saw
of
annie
moffat
s
pretty
things
,
the
more
she
envied
her
and
sighed
to
be
rich
.
home
now
looked
bare
and
dismal
as
she
thought
of
it
,
work
grew
harder
than
ever
,
and
she
felt
that
she
was
a
very
destitute
and
much
injured
girl
,
in
spite
of
the
new
gloves
and
silk
stockings
.
she
had
not
much
time
for
repining
,
however
,
for
the
three
young
girls
were
busily
employed
in
having
a
good
time
.
they
shopped
,
walked
,
rode
,
and
called
all
day
,
went
to
theaters
and
operas
or
frolicked
at
home
in
the
evening
,
for
annie
had
many
friends
and
knew
how
to
entertain
them
.
her
older
sisters
were
very
fine
young
ladies
,
and
one
was
engaged
,
which
was
extremely
interesting
and
romantic
,
meg
thought
.
mr
.
moffat
was
a
fat
,
jolly
old
gentleman
,
who
knew
her
father
,
and
mrs
.
moffat
,
a
fat
,
jolly
old
lady
,
who
took
as
great
a
fancy
to
meg
as
her
daughter
had
done
.
everyone
petted
her
,
and
daisey
,
as
they
called
her
,
was
in
a
fair
way
to
have
her
head
turned
.
when
the
evening
for
the
small
party
came
,
she
found
that
the
poplin
wouldn
t
do
at
all
,
for
the
other
girls
were
putting
on
thin
dresses
and
making
themselves
very
fine
indeed
.
so
out
came
the
tarlatan
,
looking
older
,
limper
,
and
shabbier
than
ever
beside
sallie
s
crisp
new
one
.
meg
saw
the
girls
glance
at
it
and
then
at
one
another
,
and
her
cheeks
began
to
burn
,
for
with
all
her
gentleness
she
was
very
proud
.
no
one
said
a
word
about
it
,
but
sallie
offered
to
dress
her
hair
,
and
annie
to
tie
her
sash
,
and
belle
,
the
engaged
sister
,
praised
her
white
arms
.
but
in
their
kindness
meg
saw
only
pity
for
her
poverty
,
and
her
heart
felt
very
heavy
as
she
stood
by
herself
,
while
the
others
laughed
,
chattered
,
and
flew
about
like
gauzy
butterflies
.
the
hard
,
bitter
feeling
was
getting
pretty
bad
,
when
the
maid
brought
in
a
box
of
flowers
.
before
she
could
speak
,
annie
had
the
cover
off
,
and
all
were
exclaiming
at
the
lovely
roses
,
heath
,
and
fern
within
.
it
s
for
belle
,
of
course
,
george
always
sends
her
some
,
but
these
are
altogether
ravishing
,
cried
annie
,
with
a
great
sniff
.
they
are
for
miss
march
,
the
man
said
.
and
here
s
a
note
,
put
in
the
maid
,
holding
it
to
meg
.
what
fun
!
who
are
they
from
?
didn
t
know
you
had
a
lover
,
cried
the
girls
,
fluttering
about
meg
in
a
high
state
of
curiosity
and
surprise
.
the
note
is
from
mother
,
and
the
flowers
from
laurie
,
said
meg
simply
,
yet
much
gratified
that
he
had
not
forgotten
her
.
oh
,
indeed
!
said
annie
with
a
funny
look
,
as
meg
slipped
the
note
into
her
pocket
as
a
sort
of
talisman
against
envy
,
vanity
,
and
false
pride
,
for
the
few
loving
words
had
done
her
good
,
and
the
flowers
cheered
her
up
by
their
beauty
.
feeling
almost
happy
again
,
she
laid
by
a
few
ferns
and
roses
for
herself
,
and
quickly
made
up
the
rest
in
dainty
bouquets
for
the
breasts
,
hair
,
or
skirts
of
her
friends
,
offering
them
so
prettily
that
clara
,
the
elder
sister
,
told
her
she
was
the
sweetest
little
thing
she
ever
saw
,
and
they
looked
quite
charmed
with
her
small
attention
.
somehow
the
kind
act
finished
her
despondency
,
and
when
all
the
rest
went
to
show
themselves
to
mrs
.
moffat
,
she
saw
a
happy
,
bright
eyed
face
in
the
mirror
,
as
she
laid
her
ferns
against
her
rippling
hair
and
fastened
the
roses
in
the
dress
that
didn
t
strike
her
as
so
very
shabby
now
.
she
enjoyed
herself
very
much
that
evening
,
for
she
danced
to
her
heart
s
content
.
everyone
was
very
kind
,
and
she
had
three
compliments
.
annie
made
her
sing
,
and
some
one
said
she
had
a
remarkably
fine
voice
.
major
lincoln
asked
who
the
fresh
little
girl
with
the
beautiful
eyes
was
,
and
mr
.
moffat
insisted
on
dancing
with
her
because
she
didn
t
dawdle
,
but
had
some
spring
in
her
,
as
he
gracefully
expressed
it
.
so
altogether
she
had
a
very
nice
time
,
till
she
overheard
a
bit
of
conversation
,
which
disturbed
her
extremely
.
she
was
sitting
just
inside
the
conservatory
,
waiting
for
her
partner
to
bring
her
an
ice
,
when
she
heard
a
voice
ask
on
the
other
side
of
the
flowery
wall
...
how
old
is
he
?
sixteen
or
seventeen
,
i
should
say
,
replied
another
voice
.
it
would
be
a
grand
thing
for
one
of
those
girls
,
wouldn
t
it
?
sallie
says
they
are
very
intimate
now
,
and
the
old
man
quite
dotes
on
them
.
mrs
.
m
.
has
made
her
plans
,
i
dare
say
,
and
will
play
her
cards
well
,
early
as
it
is
.
the
girl
evidently
doesn
t
think
of
it
yet
,
said
mrs
.
moffat
.
she
told
that
fib
about
her
momma
,
as
if
she
did
know
,
and
colored
up
when
the
flowers
came
quite
prettily
.
poor
thing
!
she
d
be
so
nice
if
she
was
only
got
up
in
style
.
do
you
think
she
d
be
offended
if
we
offered
to
lend
her
a
dress
for
thursday
?
asked
another
voice
.
she
s
proud
,
but
i
don
t
believe
she
d
mind
,
for
that
dowdy
tarlaton
is
all
she
has
got
.
she
may
tear
it
tonight
,
and
that
will
be
a
good
excuse
for
offering
a
decent
one
.
here
meg
s
partner
appeared
,
to
find
her
looking
much
flushed
and
rather
agitated
.
she
was
proud
,
and
her
pride
was
useful
just
then
,
for
it
helped
her
hide
her
mortification
,
anger
,
and
disgust
at
what
she
had
just
heard
.
for
,
innocent
and
unsuspicious
as
she
was
,
she
could
not
help
understanding
the
gossip
of
her
friends
.
she
tried
to
forget
it
,
but
could
not
,
and
kept
repeating
to
herself
,
mrs
.
m
.
has
made
her
plans
,
that
fib
about
her
mamma
,
and
dowdy
tarlaton
,
till
she
was
ready
to
cry
and
rush
home
to
tell
her
troubles
and
ask
for
advice
.
as
that
was
impossible
,
she
did
her
best
to
seem
gay
,
and
being
rather
excited
,
she
succeeded
so
well
that
no
one
dreamed
what
an
effort
she
was
making
.
she
was
very
glad
when
it
was
all
over
and
she
was
quiet
in
her
bed
,
where
she
could
think
and
wonder
and
fume
till
her
head
ached
and
her
hot
cheeks
were
cooled
by
a
few
natural
tears
.
those
foolish
,
yet
well
meant
words
,
had
opened
a
new
world
to
meg
,
and
much
disturbed
the
peace
of
the
old
one
in
which
till
now
she
had
lived
as
happily
as
a
child
.
her
innocent
friendship
with
laurie
was
spoiled
by
the
silly
speeches
she
had
overheard
.
her
faith
in
her
mother
was
a
little
shaken
by
the
worldly
plans
attributed
to
her
by
mrs
.
moffat
,
who
judged
others
by
herself
,
and
the
sensible
resolution
to
be
contented
with
the
simple
wardrobe
which
suited
a
poor
man
s
daughter
was
weakened
by
the
unnecessary
pity
of
girls
who
thought
a
shabby
dress
one
of
the
greatest
calamities
under
heaven
.
poor
meg
had
a
restless
night
,
and
got
up
heavy
eyed
,
unhappy
,
half
resentful
toward
her
friends
,
and
half
ashamed
of
herself
for
not
speaking
out
frankly
and
setting
everything
right
.
everybody
dawdled
that
morning
,
and
it
was
noon
before
the
girls
found
energy
enough
even
to
take
up
their
worsted
work
.
something
in
the
manner
of
her
friends
struck
meg
at
once
.
they
treated
her
with
more
respect
,
she
thought
,
took
quite
a
tender
interest
in
what
she
said
,
and
looked
at
her
with
eyes
that
plainly
betrayed
curiosity
.
all
this
surprised
and
flattered
her
,
though
she
did
not
understand
it
till
miss
belle
looked
up
from
her
writing
,
and
said
,
with
a
sentimental
air
...
daisy
,
dear
,
i
ve
sent
an
invitation
to
your
friend
,
mr
.
laurence
,
for
thursday
.
we
should
like
to
know
him
,
and
it
s
only
a
proper
compliment
to
you
.
meg
colored
,
but
a
mischievous
fancy
to
tease
the
girls
made
her
reply
demurely
,
you
are
very
kind
,
but
i
m
afraid
he
won
t
come
.
why
not
,
cherie
?
asked
miss
belle
.
he
s
too
old
.
my
child
,
what
do
you
mean
?
what
is
his
age
,
i
beg
to
know
!
cried
miss
clara
.
nearly
seventy
,
i
believe
,
answered
meg
,
counting
stitches
to
hide
the
merriment
in
her
eyes
.
you
sly
creature
!
of
course
we
meant
the
young
man
,
exclaimed
miss
belle
,
laughing
.
there
isn
t
any
,
laurie
is
only
a
little
boy
.
and
meg
laughed
also
at
the
queer
look
which
the
sisters
exchanged
as
she
thus
described
her
supposed
lover
.
about
your
age
,
nan
said
.
nearer
my
sister
jo
s
i
am
seventeen
in
august
,
returned
meg
,
tossing
her
head
.
it
s
very
nice
of
him
to
send
you
flowers
,
isn
t
it
?
said
annie
,
looking
wise
about
nothing
.
yes
,
he
often
does
,
to
all
of
us
,
for
their
house
is
full
,
and
we
are
so
fond
of
them
.
my
mother
and
old
mr
.
laurence
are
friends
,
you
know
,
so
it
is
quite
natural
that
we
children
should
play
together
,
and
meg
hoped
they
would
say
no
more
.
it
s
evident
daisy
isn
t
out
yet
,
said
miss
clara
to
belle
with
a
nod
.
quite
a
pastoral
state
of
innocence
all
round
,
returned
miss
belle
with
a
shrug
.
i
m
going
out
to
get
some
little
matters
for
my
girls
.
can
i
do
anything
for
you
,
young
ladies
?
asked
mrs
.
moffat
,
lumbering
in
like
an
elephant
in
silk
and
lace
.
no
,
thank
you
,
ma
am
,
replied
sallie
.
i
ve
got
my
new
pink
silk
for
thursday
and
don
t
want
a
thing
.
nor
i
...
began
meg
,
but
stopped
because
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
did
want
several
things
and
could
not
have
them
.
what
shall
you
wear
?
asked
sallie
.
my
old
white
one
again
,
if
i
can
mend
it
fit
to
be
seen
,
it
got
sadly
torn
last
night
,
said
meg
,
trying
to
speak
quite
easily
,
but
feeling
very
uncomfortable
.
why
don
t
you
send
home
for
another
?
said
sallie
,
who
was
not
an
observing
young
lady
.
i
haven
t
got
any
other
.
it
cost
meg
an
effort
to
say
that
,
but
sallie
did
not
see
it
and
exclaimed
in
amiable
surprise
,
only
that
?
how
funny
...
she
did
not
finish
her
speech
,
for
belle
shook
her
head
at
her
and
broke
in
,
saying
kindly
...
not
at
all
.
where
is
the
use
of
having
a
lot
of
dresses
when
she
isn
t
out
yet
?
there
s
no
need
of
sending
home
,
daisy
,
even
if
you
had
a
dozen
,
for
i
ve
got
a
sweet
blue
silk
laid
away
,
which
i
ve
outgrown
,
and
you
shall
wear
it
to
please
me
,
won
t
you
,
dear
?
you
are
very
kind
,
but
i
don
t
mind
my
old
dress
if
you
don
t
,
it
does
well
enough
for
a
little
girl
like
me
,
said
meg
.
now
do
let
me
please
myself
by
dressing
you
up
in
style
.
i
admire
to
do
it
,
and
you
d
be
a
regular
little
beauty
with
a
touch
here
and
there
.
i
shan
t
let
anyone
see
you
till
you
are
done
,
and
then
we
ll
burst
upon
them
like
cinderella
and
her
godmother
going
to
the
ball
,
said
belle
in
her
persuasive
tone
.
meg
couldn
t
refuse
the
offer
so
kindly
made
,
for
a
desire
to
see
if
she
would
be
a
little
beauty
after
touching
up
caused
her
to
accept
and
forget
all
her
former
uncomfortable
feelings
toward
the
moffats
.
on
the
thursday
evening
,
belle
shut
herself
up
with
her
maid
,
and
between
them
they
turned
meg
into
a
fine
lady
.
they
crimped
and
curled
her
hair
,
they
polished
her
neck
and
arms
with
some
fragrant
powder
,
touched
her
lips
with
coralline
salve
to
make
them
redder
,
and
hortense
would
have
added
a
soupcon
of
rouge
,
if
meg
had
not
rebelled
.
they
laced
her
into
a
sky
blue
dress
,
which
was
so
tight
she
could
hardly
breathe
and
so
low
in
the
neck
that
modest
meg
blushed
at
herself
in
the
mirror
.
a
set
of
silver
filagree
was
added
,
bracelets
,
necklace
,
brooch
,
and
even
earrings
,
for
hortense
tied
them
on
with
a
bit
of
pink
silk
which
did
not
show
.
a
cluster
of
tea
rose
buds
at
the
bosom
,
and
a
ruche
,
reconciled
meg
to
the
display
of
her
pretty
,
white
shoulders
,
and
a
pair
of
high
heeled
silk
boots
satisfied
the
last
wish
of
her

a
lace
handkerchief
,
a
plumy
fan
,
and
a
bouquet
in
a
shoulder
holder
finished
her
off
,
and
miss
belle
surveyed
her
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
little
girl
with
a
newly
dressed
doll
.
mademoiselle
is
charmante
,
tres
jolie
,
is
she
not
?
cried
hortense
,
clasping
her
hands
in
an
affected
rapture
.
come
and
show
yourself
,
said
miss
belle
,
leading
the
way
to
the
room
where
the
others
were
waiting
.
as
meg
went
rustling
after
,
with
her
long
skirts
trailing
,
her
earrings
tinkling
,
her
curls
waving
,
and
her
heart
beating
,
she
felt
as
if
her
fun
had
really
begun
at
last
,
for
the
mirror
had
plainly
told
her
that
she
was
a
little
beauty
.
her
friends
repeated
the
pleasing
phrase
enthusiastically
,
and
for
several
minutes
she
stood
,
like
a
jackdaw
in
the
fable
,
enjoying
her
borrowed
plumes
,
while
the
rest
chattered
like
a
party
of
magpies
.
while
i
dress
,
do
you
drill
her
,
nan
,
in
the
management
of
her
skirt
and
those
french
heels
,
or
she
will
trip
herself
up
.
take
your
silver
butterfly
,
and
catch
up
that
long
curl
on
the
left
side
of
her
head
,
clara
,
and
don
t
any
of
you
disturb
the
charming
work
of
my
hands
,
said
belle
,
as
she
hurried
away
,
looking
well
pleased
with
her
success
.
you
don
t
look
a
bit
like
yourself
,
but
you
are
very
nice
.
i
m
nowhere
beside
you
,
for
belle
has
heaps
of
taste
,
and
you
re
quite
french
,
i
assure
you
.
let
your
flowers
hang
,
don
t
be
so
careful
of
them
,
and
be
sure
you
don
t
trip
,
returned
sallie
,
trying
not
to
care
that
meg
was
prettier
than
herself
.
keeping
that
warning
carefully
in
mind
,
margaret
got
safely
down
stairs
and
sailed
into
the
drawing
rooms
where
the
moffats
and
a
few
early
guests
were
assembled
.
she
very
soon
discovered
that
there
is
a
charm
about
fine
clothes
which
attracts
a
certain
class
of
people
and
secures
their
respect
.
several
young
ladies
,
who
had
taken
no
notice
of
her
before
,
were
very
affectionate
all
of
a
sudden
.
several
young
gentlemen
,
who
had
only
stared
at
her
at
the
other
party
,
now
not
only
stared
,
but
asked
to
be
introduced
,
and
said
all
manner
of
foolish
but
agreeable
things
to
her
,
and
several
old
ladies
,
who
sat
on
the
sofas
,
and
criticized
the
rest
of
the
party
,
inquired
who
she
was
with
an
air
of
interest
.
she
heard
mrs
.
moffat
reply
to
one
of
them
...
daisy
march
father
a
colonel
in
the
army
one
of
our
first
families
,
but
reverses
of
fortune
,
you
know
intimate
friends
of
the
laurences
sweet
creature
,
i
assure
you
my
ned
is
quite
wild
about
her
.
dear
me
!
said
the
old
lady
,
putting
up
her
glass
for
another
observation
of
meg
,
who
tried
to
look
as
if
she
had
not
heard
and
been
rather
shocked
at
mrs
.
moffat
s
fibs
.
the
queer
feeling
did
not
pass
away
,
but
she
imagined
herself
acting
the
new
part
of
fine
lady
and
so
got
on
pretty
well
,
though
the
tight
dress
gave
her
a
side
ache
,
the
train
kept
getting
under
her
feet
,
and
she
was
in
constant
fear
lest
her
earrings
should
fly
off
and
get
lost
or
broken
.
she
was
flirting
her
fan
and
laughing
at
the
feeble
jokes
of
a
young
gentleman
who
tried
to
be
witty
,
when
she
suddenly
stopped
laughing
and
looked
confused
,
for
just
opposite
,
she
saw
laurie
.
he
was
staring
at
her
with
undisguised
surprise
,
and
disapproval
also
,
she
thought
,
for
though
he
bowed
and
smiled
,
yet
something
in
his
honest
eyes
made
her
blush
and
wish
she
had
her
old
dress
on
.
to
complete
her
confusion
,
she
saw
belle
nudge
annie
,
and
both
glance
from
her
to
laurie
,
who
,
she
was
happy
to
see
,
looked
unusually
boyish
and
shy
.
silly
creatures
,
to
put
such
thoughts
into
my
head
.
i
won
t
care
for
it
,
or
let
it
change
me
a
bit
,
thought
meg
,
and
rustled
across
the
room
to
shake
hands
with
her
friend
.
i
m
glad
you
came
,
i
was
afraid
you
wouldn
t
.
she
said
,
with
her
most
grown
up
air
.
jo
wanted
me
to
come
,
and
tell
her
how
you
looked
,
so
i
did
,
answered
laurie
,
without
turning
his
eyes
upon
her
,
though
he
half
smiled
at
her
maternal
tone
.
what
shall
you
tell
her
?
asked
meg
,
full
of
curiosity
to
know
his
opinion
of
her
,
yet
feeling
ill
at
ease
with
him
for
the
first
time
.
i
shall
say
i
didn
t
know
you
,
for
you
look
so
grown
up
and
unlike
yourself
,
i
m
quite
afraid
of
you
,
he
said
,
fumbling
at
his
glove
button
.
how
absurd
of
you
!
the
girls
dressed
me
up
for
fun
,
and
i
rather
like
it
.
wouldn
t
jo
stare
if
she
saw
me
?
said
meg
,
bent
on
making
him
say
whether
he
thought
her
improved
or
not
.
yes
,
i
think
she
would
,
returned
laurie
gravely
.
don
t
you
like
me
so
?
asked
meg
.
no
,
i
don
t
,
was
the
blunt
reply
.
why
not
?
in
an
anxious
tone
.
he
glanced
at
her
frizzled
head
,
bare
shoulders
,
and
fantastically
trimmed
dress
with
an
expression
that
abashed
her
more
than
his
answer
,
which
had
not
a
particle
of
his
usual
politeness
in
it
.
i
don
t
like
fuss
and
feathers
.
that
was
altogether
too
much
from
a
lad
younger
than
herself
,
and
meg
walked
away
,
saying
petulantly
,
you
are
the
rudest
boy
i
ever
saw
.
feeling
very
much
ruffled
,
she
went
and
stood
at
a
quiet
window
to
cool
her
cheeks
,
for
the
tight
dress
gave
her
an
uncomfortably
brilliant
color
.
as
she
stood
there
,
major
lincoln
passed
by
,
and
a
minute
after
she
heard
him
saying
to
his
mother
...
they
are
making
a
fool
of
that
little
girl
.
i
wanted
you
to
see
her
,
but
they
have
spoiled
her
entirely
.
she
s
nothing
but
a
doll
tonight
.
oh
,
dear
!
sighed
meg
.
i
wish
i
d
been
sensible
and
worn
my
own
things
,
then
i
should
not
have
disgusted
other
people
,
or
felt
so
uncomfortable
and
ashamed
of
myself
.
she
leaned
her
forehead
on
the
cool
pane
,
and
stood
half
hidden
by
the
curtains
,
never
minding
that
her
favorite
waltz
had
begun
,
till
some
one
touched
her
,
and
turning
,
she
saw
laurie
,
looking
penitent
,
as
he
said
,
with
his
very
best
bow
and
his
hand
out
...
please
forgive
my
rudeness
,
and
come
and
dance
with
me
.
i
m
afraid
it
will
be
too
disagreeable
to
you
,
said
meg
,
trying
to
look
offended
and
failing
entirely
.
not
a
bit
of
it
,
i
m
dying
to
do
it
.
come
,
i
ll
be
good
.
i
don
t
like
your
gown
,
but
i
do
think
you
are
just
splendid
.
and
he
waved
his
hands
,
as
if
words
failed
to
express
his
admiration
.
meg
smiled
and
relented
,
and
whispered
as
they
stood
waiting
to
catch
the
time
,
take
care
my
skirt
doesn
t
trip
you
up
.
it
s
the
plague
of
my
life
and
i
was
a
goose
to
wear
it
.
pin
it
round
your
neck
,
and
then
it
will
be
useful
,
said
laurie
,
looking
down
at
the
little
blue
boots
,
which
he
evidently
approved
of
.
away
they
went
fleetly
and
gracefully
,
for
having
practiced
at
home
,
they
were
well
matched
,
and
the
blithe
young
couple
were
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
,
as
they
twirled
merrily
round
and
round
,
feeling
more
friendly
than
ever
after
their
small
tiff
.
laurie
,
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
,
will
you
?
said
meg
,
as
he
stood
fanning
her
when
her
breath
gave
out
,
which
it
did
very
soon
though
she
would
not
own
why
.
won
t
i
!
said
laurie
,
with
alacrity
.
please
don
t
tell
them
at
home
about
my
dress
tonight
.
they
won
t
understand
the
joke
,
and
it
will
worry
mother
.
then
why
did
you
do
it
?
said
laurie
s
eyes
,
so
plainly
that
meg
hastily
added
...
i
shall
tell
them
myself
all
about
it
,
and
fess
to
mother
how
silly
i
ve
been
.
but
i
d
rather
do
it
myself
.
so
you
ll
not
tell
,
will
you
?
i
give
you
my
word
i
won
t
,
only
what
shall
i
say
when
they
ask
me
?
just
say
i
looked
pretty
well
and
was
having
a
good
time
.
i
ll
say
the
first
with
all
my
heart
,
but
how
about
the
other
?
you
don
t
look
as
if
you
were
having
a
good
time
.
are
you
?
and
laurie
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
which
made
her
answer
in
a
whisper
...
no
,
not
just
now
.
don
t
think
i
m
horrid
.
i
only
wanted
a
little
fun
,
but
this
sort
doesn
t
pay
,
i
find
,
and
i
m
getting
tired
of
it
.
here
comes
ned
moffat
.
what
does
he
want
?
said
laurie
,
knitting
his
black
brows
as
if
he
did
not
regard
his
young
host
in
the
light
of
a
pleasant
addition
to
the
party
.
he
put
his
name
down
for
three
dances
,
and
i
suppose
he
s
coming
for
them
.
what
a
bore
!
said
meg
,
assuming
a
languid
air
which
amused
laurie
immensely
.
he
did
not
speak
to
her
again
till
suppertime
,
when
he
saw
her
drinking
champagne
with
ned
and
his
friend
fisher
,
who
were
behaving
like
a
pair
of
fools
,
as
laurie
said
to
himself
,
for
he
felt
a
brotherly
sort
of
right
to
watch
over
the
marches
and
fight
their
battles
whenever
a
defender
was
needed
.
you
ll
have
a
splitting
headache
tomorrow
,
if
you
drink
much
of
that
.
i
wouldn
t
,
meg
,
your
mother
doesn
t
like
it
,
you
know
,
he
whispered
,
leaning
over
her
chair
,
as
ned
turned
to
refill
her
glass
and
fisher
stooped
to
pick
up
her
fan
.
i
m
not
meg
tonight
,
i
m
a
doll
who
does
all
sorts
of
crazy
things
.
tomorrow
i
shall
put
away
my
fuss
and
feathers
and
be
desperately
good
again
,
she
answered
with
an
affected
little
laugh
.
wish
tomorrow
was
here
,
then
,
muttered
laurie
,
walking
off
,
ill
pleased
at
the
change
he
saw
in
her
.
meg
danced
and
flirted
,
chattered
and
giggled
,
as
the
other
girls
did
.
after
supper
she
undertook
the
german
,
and
blundered
through
it
,
nearly
upsetting
her
partner
with
her
long
skirt
,
and
romping
in
a
way
that
scandalized
laurie
,
who
looked
on
and
meditated
a
lecture
.
but
he
got
no
chance
to
deliver
it
,
for
meg
kept
away
from
him
till
he
came
to
say
good
night
.
remember
!
she
said
,
trying
to
smile
,
for
the
splitting
headache
had
already
begun
.
silence
a
la
mort
,
replied
laurie
,
with
a
melodramatic
flourish
,
as
he
went
away
.
this
little
bit
of
byplay
excited
annie
s
curiosity
,
but
meg
was
too
tired
for
gossip
and
went
to
bed
,
feeling
as
if
she
had
been
to
a
masquerade
and
hadn
t
enjoyed
herself
as
much
as
she
expected
.
she
was
sick
all
the
next
day
,
and
on
saturday
went
home
,
quite
used
up
with
her
fortnight
s
fun
and
feeling
that
she
had
sat
in
the
lap
of
luxury
long
enough
.
it
does
seem
pleasant
to
be
quiet
,
and
not
have
company
manners
on
all
the
time
.
home
is
a
nice
place
,
though
it
isn
t
splendid
,
said
meg
,
looking
about
her
with
a
restful
expression
,
as
she
sat
with
her
mother
and
jo
on
the
sunday
evening
.
i
m
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
,
dear
,
for
i
was
afraid
home
would
seem
dull
and
poor
to
you
after
your
fine
quarters
,
replied
her
mother
,
who
had
given
her
many
anxious
looks
that
day
.
for
motherly
eyes
are
quick
to
see
any
change
in
children
s
faces
.
meg
had
told
her
adventures
gayly
and
said
over
and
over
what
a
charming
time
she
had
had
,
but
something
still
seemed
to
weigh
upon
her
spirits
,
and
when
the
younger
girls
were
gone
to
bed
,
she
sat
thoughtfully
staring
at
the
fire
,
saying
little
and
looking
worried
.
as
the
clock
struck
nine
and
jo
proposed
bed
,
meg
suddenly
left
her
chair
and
,
taking
beth
s
stool
,
leaned
her
elbows
on
her
mother
s
knee
,
saying
bravely
...
marmee
,
i
want
to
fess
.
i
thought
so
.
what
is
it
,
dear
?
shall
i
go
away
?
asked
jo
discreetly
.
of
course
not
.
don
t
i
always
tell
you
everything
?
i
was
ashamed
to
speak
of
it
before
the
younger
children
,
but
i
want
you
to
know
all
the
dreadful
things
i
did
at
the
moffats
.
we
are
prepared
,
said
mrs
.
march
,
smiling
but
looking
a
little
anxious
.
i
told
you
they
dressed
me
up
,
but
i
didn
t
tell
you
that
they
powdered
and
squeezed
and
frizzled
,
and
made
me
look
like
a
fashion
plate
.
laurie
thought
i
wasn
t
proper
.
i
know
he
did
,
though
he
didn
t
say
so
,
and
one
man
called
me
a
doll
.
i
knew
it
was
silly
,
but
they
flattered
me
and
said
i
was
a
beauty
,
and
quantities
of
nonsense
,
so
i
let
them
make
a
fool
of
me
.
is
that
all
?
asked
jo
,
as
mrs
.
march
looked
silently
at
the
downcast
face
of
her
pretty
daughter
,
and
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
blame
her
little
follies
.
no
,
i
drank
champagne
and
romped
and
tried
to
flirt
,
and
was
altogether
abominable
,
said
meg
self
reproachfully
.
there
is
something
more
,
i
think
.
and
mrs
.
march
smoothed
the
soft
cheek
,
which
suddenly
grew
rosy
as
meg
answered
slowly
...
yes
.
it
s
very
silly
,
but
i
want
to
tell
it
,
because
i
hate
to
have
people
say
and
think
such
things
about
us
and
laurie
.
then
she
told
the
various
bits
of
gossip
she
had
heard
at
the
moffats
,
and
as
she
spoke
,
jo
saw
her
mother
fold
her
lips
tightly
,
as
if
ill
pleased
that
such
ideas
should
be
put
into
meg
s
innocent
mind
.
well
,
if
that
isn
t
the
greatest
rubbish
i
ever
heard
,
cried
jo
indignantly
.
why
didn
t
you
pop
out
and
tell
them
so
on
the
spot
?
i
couldn
t
,
it
was
so
embarrassing
for
me
.
i
couldn
t
help
hearing
at
first
,

show

very

little

kind

dare
say

worldly

ill

full

serious
subject

you

silence

the

rustle
of

in

through

neither

removed
their
masks

curiosity

wonder
possessed
all
hearts

respect
restrained
all
tongues
till
the
holy
rite
was
over

the
eager
spectators
gathered
round
the
count
,
demanding
an
explanation

gladly
would
i
give
it
if
i
could
,

i
only
know
that
it
was
the
whim

to
it

receive

but
neither
bent
the
knee
,
for
the
young
bridegroom
replied
in
a
tone
that
startled
all
listeners
as
the
mask
fell
,
disclosing
the
noble
face
of
ferdinand
devereux
,
the
artist
lover
,
and
leaning
on
the
breast
where
now
flashed
the
star
of
an
english
earl
was
the
lovely
viola
,
radiant
with
joy
and
beauty
.
my
lord
,
you
scornfully
bade
me
claim
your
daughter
when
i
could
boast
as
high
a
name
and
vast
a
fortune
as
the
count
antonio
.
i
can
do
more
,
for
even
your
ambitious
soul
cannot
refuse
the
earl
of
devereux
and
de
vere
,
when
he
gives
his
ancient
name
and
boundless
wealth
in
return
for
the
beloved
hand
of
this
fair
lady
,
now
my
wife
.
the
count
stood
like
one
changed
to
stone
,
and
turning
to
the
bewildered
crowd
,
ferdinand
added
,
with
a
gay
smile
of
triumph
,
to
you
,
my
gallant
friends
,
i
can
only
wish
that
your
wooing
may
prosper
as
mine
has
done
,

that
you
may

win

morning
,
a
little
girl
in
a
brown
hat
and
blue
dress
,
with
a
round
face
and
snub
nose
,
went
and
bought
it
for
her
mother
.
she
lugged
it
home
,
cut
it
up
,
and
boiled
it
in
the
big
pot
,
mashed
some
of
it
with
salt
and
butter
,
for
dinner
.
and
to
the
rest
she
added
a
pint
of
milk
,
two
eggs
,
four
spoons
of
sugar
,
nutmeg
,
and
some
crackers
,
put
it
in
a
deep
dish
,
and
baked
it
till
it
was
brown
and
nice
,
and
next
day
it
was
eaten
by
a
family
named

you

the
sinner
i

is
a
man
named
winkle
who
makes
trouble
in
his
club
by
laughing
and
sometimes
won
t
write
his
piece
in
this
fine
paper
i
hope
you
will
pardon
his
badness
and
let
him
send
a
french
fable
because
he
can
t
write
out
of
his
head
as
he
has
so
many
lessons
to
do
and
no
brains
in
future
i
will
try
to
take
time
by

a
sad
accident
on
friday
last
,
we
were
startled
by
a
violent
shock
in
our
basement
,
followed
by
cries
of
distress
.
on
rushing
in
a
body
to
the
cellar
,
we
discovered
our
beloved
president
prostrate
upon
the
floor
,
having
tripped
and
fallen
while
getting
wood
for
domestic
purposes
.
a
perfect
scene
of
ruin
met
our
eyes

for

his
fall
mr

pickwick
had
plunged
his
head
and
shoulders
into
a
tub
of
water
,
upset
a
keg
of
soft
soap
upon
his
manly
form
,
and
torn
his
garments
badly
.
on
being
removed
from
this
perilous
situation
,
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
suffered
no
injury
but
several
bruises
,
and
we
are
happy
to
add
,
is
now
doing

this
lovely
and

cat
was
the
pet
of
a
large
circle
of
warm
and
admiring
friends
for
her
beauty
attracted
all

her
graces

virtues
endeared
her
to
all
hearts
,
and
her
loss
is
deeply
felt
by
the
whole
community
.
when
last
seen
,
she
was
sitting
at
the
gate
,
watching
the
butcher

cart
,

it
is
feared
that
some
villain

tempted
by

charms

basely
stole

weeks
have
passed

no

we
relinquish

aside

as
the

finished
reading
the
paper
which
i
beg
leave
to
assure
my
readers
is
a
bona
fide
copy
of
one
written
by

once
upon
a
time
,
a
round
of
applause
followed
,
and
then
mr
.
snodgrass
rose
to
make
a
proposition
.
mr
.
president
and
gentlemen
,
he
began
,
assuming
a
parliamentary
attitude
and
tone
,
i
wish
to
propose
the
admission
of
a
new
member
one
who
highly
deserves
the
honor
,
would
be
deeply
grateful
for
it
,
and
would
add
immensely
to
the
spirit
of
the
club
,
the
literary
value
of
the
paper
,
and
be
no
end
jolly
and
nice
.
i
propose
mr
.
theodore
laurence
as
an
honorary
member
of
the
p
.
c
.
come
now
,
do
have
him
.
jo
s
sudden
change
of
tone
made
the
girls
laugh
,
but
all
looked
rather
anxious
,
and
no
one
said
a
word
as
snodgrass
took
his
seat
.
we
ll
put
it
to
a
vote
,
said
the
president
.
all
in
favor
of
this
motion
please
to
manifest
it
by
saying
,
aye
.
a
loud
response
from
snodgrass
,
followed
,
to
everybody
s
surprise
,
by
a
timid
one
from
beth
.
contrary
minded
say
,
no
.
meg
and
amy
were
contrary
minded
,
and
mr
.
winkle
rose
to
say
with
great
elegance
,
we
don
t
wish
any
boys
,
they
only
joke
and
bounce
about
.
this
is
a
ladies
club
,
and
we
wish
to
be
private
and
proper
.
i
m
afraid
he
ll
laugh
at
our
paper
,
and
make
fun
of
us
afterward
,
observed
pickwick
,
pulling
the
little
curl
on
her
forehead
,
as
she
always
did
when
doubtful
.
up
rose
snodgrass
,
very
much
in
earnest
.
sir
,
i
give
you
my
word
as
a
gentleman
,
laurie
won
t
do
anything
of
the
sort
.
he
likes
to
write
,
and
he
ll
give
a
tone
to
our
contributions
and
keep
us
from
being
sentimental
,
don
t
you
see
?
we
can
do
so
little
for
him
,
and
he
does
so
much
for
us
,
i
think
the
least
we
can
do
is
to
offer
him
a
place
here
,
and
make
him
welcome
if
he
comes
.
this
artful
allusion
to
benefits
conferred
brought
tupman
to
his
feet
,
looking
as
if
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
.
yes
we
ought
to
do
it
,
even
if
we
are
afraid
.
i
say
he
may
come
,
and
his
grandpa
,
too
,
if
he
likes
.
this
spirited
burst
from
beth
electrified
the
club
,
and
jo
left
her
seat
to
shake
hands
approvingly
.
now
then
,
vote
again
.
everybody
remember
it
s
our
laurie
,
and
say
,
aye
!
cried
snodgrass
excitedly
.
aye
!
aye
!
aye
!
replied
three
voices
at
once
.
good
!
bless
you
!
now
,
as
there
s
nothing
like
taking
time
by
the
fetlock
,
as
winkle
characteristically
observes
,
allow
me
to
present
the
new
member
.
and
,
to
the
dismay
of
the
rest
of
the
club
,
jo
threw
open
the
door
of
the
closet
,
and
displayed
laurie
sitting
on
a
rag
bag
,
flushed
and
twinkling
with
suppressed
laughter
.
you
rogue
!
you
traitor
!
jo
,
how
could
you
?
cried
the
three
girls
,
as
snodgrass
led
her
friend
triumphantly
forth
,
and
producing
both
a
chair
and
a
badge
,
installed
him
in
a
jiffy
.
the
coolness
of
you
two
rascals
is
amazing
,
began
mr
.
pickwick
,
trying
to
get
up
an
awful
frown
and
only
succeeding
in
producing
an
amiable
smile
.
but
the
new
member
was
equal
to
the
occasion
,
and
rising
,
with
a
grateful
salutation
to
the
chair
,
said
in
the
most
engaging
manner
,
mr
.
president
and
ladies
i
beg
pardon
,
gentlemen
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
as
sam
weller
,
the
very
humble
servant
of
the
club
.
good
!
good
!
cried
jo
,
pounding
with
the
handle
of
the
old
warming
pan
on
which
she
leaned
.
my
faithful
friend
and
noble
patron
,
continued
laurie
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
,
who
has
so
flatteringly
presented
me
,
is
not
to
be
blamed
for
the
base
stratagem
of
tonight
.
i
planned
it
,
and
she
only
gave
in
after
lots
of
teasing
.
come
now
,
don
t
lay
it
all
on
yourself
.
you
know
i
proposed
the
cupboard
,
broke
in
snodgrass
,
who
was
enjoying
the
joke
amazingly
.
never
mind
what
she
says
.
i
m
the
wretch
that
did
it
,
sir
,
said
the
new
member
,
with
a
welleresque
nod
to
mr
.
pickwick
.
but
on
my
honor
,
i
never
will
do
so
again
,
and
henceforth
devote
myself
to
the
interest
of
this
immortal
club
.
hear
!
hear
!
cried
jo
,
clashing
the
lid
of
the
warming
pan
like
a
cymbal
.
go
on
,
go
on
!
added
winkle
and
tupman
,
while
the
president
bowed
benignly
.
i
merely
wish
to
say
,
that
as
a
slight
token
of
my
gratitude
for
the
honor
done
me
,
and
as
a
means
of
promoting
friendly
relations
between
adjoining
nations
,
i
have
set
up
a
post
office
in
the
hedge
in
the
lower
corner
of
the
garden
,
a
fine
,
spacious
building
with
padlocks
on
the
doors
and
every
convenience
for
the
mails
,
also
the
females
,
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
.
it
s
the
old
martin
house
,
but
i
ve
stopped
up
the
door
and
made
the
roof
open
,
so
it
will
hold
all
sorts
of
things
,
and
save
our
valuable
time
.
letters
,
manuscripts
,
books
,
and
bundles
can
be
passed
in
there
,
and
as
each
nation
has
a
key
,
it
will
be
uncommonly
nice
,
i
fancy
.
allow
me
to
present
the
club
key
,
and
with
many
thanks
for
your
favor
,
take
my
seat
.
great
applause
as
mr
.
weller
deposited
a
little
key
on
the
table
and
subsided
,
the
warming
pan
clashed
and
waved
wildly
,
and
it
was
some
time
before
order
could
be
restored
.
a
long
discussion
followed
,
and
everyone
came
out
surprising
,
for
everyone
did
her
best
.
so
it
was
an
unusually
lively
meeting
,
and
did
not
adjourn
till
a
late
hour
,
when
it
broke
up
with
three
shrill
cheers
for
the
new
member
.
no
one
ever
regretted
the
admittance
of
sam
weller
,
for
a
more
devoted
,
well
behaved
,
and
jovial
member
no
club
could
have
.
he
certainly
did
add
spirit
to
the
meetings
,
and
a
tone
to
the
paper
,
for
his
orations
convulsed
his
hearers
and
his
contributions
were
excellent
,
being
patriotic
,
classical
,
comical
,
or
dramatic
,
but
never
sentimental
.
jo
regarded
them
as
worthy
of

,

,
or

,
and
remodeled
her
own
works
with
good
effect

she
thought

the
p

o

was
a
capital
little
institution
,
and
flourished
wonderfully
,
for
nearly
as
many
queer
things
passed
through
it
as
through
the
real
post
office
.
tragedies
and
cravats
,
poetry
and
pickles
,
garden
seeds
and
long
letters
,
music
and
gingerbread
,
rubbers
,
invitations
,
scoldings
,
and
puppies
.
the
old
gentleman
liked
the
fun
,
and
amused
himself
by
sending
odd
bundles
,
mysterious
messages
,
and
funny
telegrams
,
and
his
gardener
,
who
was
smitten
with
hannah
s
charms
,
actually
sent
a
love
letter
to
jo
s
care
.
how
they
laughed
when
the
secret
came
out
,
never
dreaming
how
many
love
letters
that
little
post
office
would
hold
in
the
years
to
come

exclaimed
meg
,
coming
home
one
warm
day
to
find
jo
laid
upon
the
sofa
in
an
unusual
state
of
exhaustion
,
while
beth
took
off
her
dusty
boots
,
and
amy
made
lemonade
for
the
refreshment
of
the
whole
party
.
aunt
march
went
today
,
for
which
,
oh
,
be
joyful
!
said
jo
.
i
was
mortally
afraid
she
d
ask
me
to
go
with
her
.
if
she
had
,
i
should
have
felt
as
if
i
ought
to
do
it
,
but
plumfield
is
about
as
gay
as
a
churchyard
,
you
know
,
and
i
d
rather
be
excused
.
we
had
a
flurry
getting
the
old
lady
off
,
and
i
had
a
fright
every
time
she
spoke
to
me
,
for
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
be
through
that
i
was
uncommonly
helpful
and
sweet
,
and
feared
she
d
find
it
impossible
to
part
from
me
.
i
quaked
till
she
was
fairly
in
the
carriage
,
and
had
a
final
fright
,
for
as
it
drove
of
,
she
popped
out
her
head
,
saying
,
josyphine
,
won
t
you
?
i
didn
t
hear
any
more
,
for
i
basely
turned
and
fled
.
i
did
actually
run
,
and
whisked
round
the
corner
where
i
felt
safe
.
poor
old
jo
!
she
came
in
looking
as
if
bears
were
after
her
,
said
beth
,
as
she
cuddled
her
sister
s
feet
with
a
motherly
air
.
aunt
march
is
a
regular
samphire
,
is
she
not
?
observed
amy
,
tasting
her
mixture
critically
.
she
means
vampire
,
not
seaweed
,
but
it
doesn
t
matter
.
it
s
too
warm
to
be
particular
about
one
s
parts
of
speech
,
murmured
jo
.
what
shall
you
do
all

asked
amy
,
changing
the
subject
with
tact
.
i
shall
lie
abed
late
,
and
do
nothing
,
replied
meg
,
from
the
depths
of
the
rocking
chair
.
i
ve
been
routed
up
early
all
winter
and
had
to
spend
my
days
working
for
other
people
,
so
now
i
m
going
to
rest
and
revel
to
my
heart
s
content
.
no
,
said
jo
,
that
dozy
way
wouldn
t
suit
me
.
i
ve
laid
in
a
heap
of
books
,
and
i
m
going
to
improve
my
shining
hours
reading
on
my
perch
in
the
old
apple
tree
,
when
i
m
not
having
l
don
t
say
larks
!
implored
amy
,
as
a
return
snub
for
the
samphire
correction
.
i
ll
say
nightingales
then
,
with
laurie
.
that
s
proper
and
appropriate
,
since
he
s
a
warbler
.
don
t
let
us
do
any
lessons
,
beth
,
for
a
while
,
but
play
all
the
time
and
rest
,
as
the
girls
mean
to
,
proposed
amy
.
well
,
i
will
,
if
mother
doesn
t
mind
.
i
want
to
learn
some
new
songs
,
and
my
children
need
fitting
up
for
the
summer
.
they
are
dreadfully
out
of
order
and
really
suffering
for
clothes
.
may
we
,
mother
?
asked
meg
,
turning
to
mrs
.
march
,
who
sat
sewing
in
what
they
called
marmee
s
corner
.
you
may
try
your
experiment
for
a
week
and
see
how
you
like
it
.
i
think
by
saturday
night
you
will
find
that
all
play
and
no
work
is
as
bad
as
all
work
and
no
play
.
oh
,
dear
,
no
!
it
will
be
delicious
,
i
m
sure
,
said
meg
complacently
.
i
now
propose
a
toast
,
as
my
friend
and
pardner
,
sairy
gamp
,
says
.
fun
forever
,
and
no
grubbing
!
cried
jo
,
rising
,
glass
in
hand
,
as
the
lemonade
went
round
.
they
all
drank
it
merrily
,
and
began
the
experiment
by
lounging
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
next
morning
,
meg
did
not
appear
till
ten
o
clock
.
her
solitary
breakfast
did
not
taste
good
,
and
the
room
seemed
lonely
and
untidy
,
for
jo
had
not
filled
the
vases
,
beth
had
not
dusted
,
and
amy
s
books
lay
scattered
about
.
nothing
was
neat
and
pleasant
but
marmee
s
corner
,
which
looked
as
usual
.
and
there
meg
sat
,
to
rest
and
read
,
which
meant
to
yawn
and
imagine
what
pretty
summer
dresses
she
would
get
with
her
salary
.
jo
spent
the
morning
on
the
river
with
laurie
and
the
afternoon
reading
and
crying
over
the
wide
,
wide
world
,
up
in
the
apple
tree
.
beth
began
by
rummaging
everything
out
of
the
big
closet
where
her
family
resided
,
but
getting
tired
before
half
done
,
she
left
her
establishment
topsy
turvy
and
went
to
her
music
,
rejoicing
that
she
had
no
dishes
to
wash
.
amy
arranged
her
bower
,
put
on
her
best
white
frock
,
smoothed
her
curls
,
and
sat
down
to
draw
under
the
honeysuckle
,
hoping
someone
would
see
and
inquire
who
the
young
artist
was
.
as
no
one
appeared
but
an
inquisitive
daddy
longlegs
,
who
examined
her
work
with
interest
,
she
went
to
walk
,
got
caught
in
a
shower
,
and
came
home
dripping
.
at
teatime
they
compared
notes
,
and
all
agreed
that
it
had
been
a
delightful
,
though
unusually
long
day
.
meg
,
who
went
shopping
in
the
afternoon
and
got
a
sweet
blue
muslin
,
had
discovered
,
after
she
had
cut
the
breadths
off
,
that
it
wouldn
t
wash
,
which
mishap
made
her
slightly
cross
.
jo
had
burned
the
skin
off
her
nose
boating
,
and
got
a
raging
headache
by
reading
too
long
.
beth
was
worried
by
the
confusion
of
her
closet
and
the
difficulty
of
learning
three
or
four
songs
at
once
,
and
amy
deeply
regretted
the
damage
done
her
frock
,
for
katy
brown
s
party
was
to
be
the
next
day
and
now
like
flora
mcflimsey
,
she
had
nothing
to
wear
.
but
these
were
mere
trifles
,
and
they
assured
their
mother
that
the
experiment
was
working
finely
.
she
smiled
,
said
nothing
,
and
with
hannah
s
help
did
their
neglected
work
,
keeping
home
pleasant
and
the
domestic
machinery
running
smoothly
.
it
was
astonishing
what
a
peculiar
and
uncomfortable
state
of
things
was
produced
by
the
resting
and
reveling
process
.
the
days
kept
getting
longer
and
longer
,
the
weather
was
unusually
variable
and
so
were
tempers
an
unsettled
feeling
possessed
everyone
,
and
satan
found
plenty
of
mischief
for
the
idle
hands
to
do
.
as
the
height
of
luxury
,
meg
put
out
some
of
her
sewing
,
and
then
found
time
hang
so
heavily
,
that
she
fell
to
snipping
and
spoiling
her
clothes
in
her
attempts
to
furbish
them
up
a
la
moffat
.
jo
read
till
her
eyes
gave
out
and
she
was
sick
of
books
,
got
so
fidgety
that
even
good
natured
laurie
had
a
quarrel
with
her
,
and
so
reduced
in
spirits
that
she
desperately
wished
she
had
gone
with
aunt
march
.
beth
got
on
pretty
well
,
for
she
was
constantly
forgetting
that
it
was
to
be
all
play
and
no
work
,
and
fell
back
into
her
old
ways
now
and
then
.
but
something
in
the
air
affected
her
,
and
more
than
once
her
tranquility
was
much
disturbed
,
so
much
so
that
on
one
occasion
she
actually
shook
poor
dear
joanna
and
told
her
she
was
a
fright
.
amy
fared
worst
of
all
,
for
her
resources
were
small
,
and
when
her
sisters
left
her
to
amuse
herself
,
she
soon
found
that
accomplished
and
important
little
self
a
great
burden
.
she
didn
t
like
dolls
,
fairy
tales
were
childish
,
and
one
couldn
t
draw
all
the
time
.
tea
parties
didn
t
amount
to
much
,
neither
did
picnics
,
unless
very
well
conducted
.
if
one
could
have
a
fine
house
,
full
of
nice
girls
,
or
go
traveling
,
the
summer
would
be
delightful
,
but
to
stay
at
home
with
three
selfish
sisters
and
a
grown
up
boy
was
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
a
boaz
,
complained
miss
malaprop
,
after
several
days
devoted
to
pleasure
,
fretting
,
and
ennui
.
no
one
would
own
that
they
were
tired
of
the
experiment
,
but
by
friday
night
each
acknowledged
to
herself
that
she
was
glad
the
week
was
nearly
done
.
hoping
to
impress
the
lesson
more
deeply
,
mrs
.
march
,
who
had
a
good
deal
of
humor
,
resolved
to
finish
off
the
trial
in
an
appropriate
manner
,
so
she
gave
hannah
a
holiday
and
let
the
girls
enjoy
the
full
effect
of
the
play
system
.
when
they
got
up
on
saturday
morning
,
there
was
no
fire
in
the
kitchen
,
no
breakfast
in
the
dining
room
,
and
no
mother
anywhere
to
be
seen
.
mercy
on
us
!
what
has
happened
?
cried
jo
,
staring
about
her
in
dismay
.
meg
ran
upstairs
and
soon
came
back
again
,
looking
relieved
but
rather
bewildered
,
and
a
little
ashamed
.
mother
isn
t
sick
,
only
very
tired
,
and
she
says
she
is
going
to
stay
quietly
in
her
room
all
day
and
let
us
do
the
best
we
can
.
it
s
a
very
queer
thing
for
her
to
do
,
she
doesn
t
act
a
bit
like
herself
.
but
she
says
it
has
been
a
hard
week
for
her
,
so
we
mustn
t
grumble
but
take
care
of
ourselves
.
that
s
easy
enough
,
and
i
like
the
idea
,
