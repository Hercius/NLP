End of the spring
And here she comes back.
Hi, hi, hi, hi there.
Them summer days
Those summer days
That's when I had
Most of my fun, back
Hi, hi, hi, hi there.
Them summer days
Those summer days
I cloud nine when I want to
Out of school, yeah!
County fair in the country sun
And everything is true.
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
Hot fun in the summertime.
Hot fun in the summertime.
Hot fun in the summertime.
Hot fun in the summertime.
First of the fall
And then she goes back
Bye, bye, bye, bye there.
Them summer days.

Boop boop boop boop!
When I want to
Out of school
County fair in the country sun.
And everything is cool.
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
Hot fun in the summertime.
Hot fun in the summertime.
Hot fun in the summertime.
Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah, yeah
There is a blue one
Who can't accept the green one.
For living with a fat one
Trying to be a skinny one.
Different strokes
For different folks.
And so on and so on.
And scooby dooby dooby.
Oh sha sha
We got to live together!
I am no better and neither are you.
We are the same, whatever we do.
You love me, you hate me, you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah yeah.
There is a long hair
That doesn't like the short hair.
For being such a rich one
That will not help the poor one.
Different strokes
For different folks!
And so on and so on
And scooby dooby dooby
Oh sha sha
We got to live together.
There is a yellow one
That won't accept the black one.
That won't accept the red one
That won't accept the white one.
Different strokes
For different folks.
And so on and so on
And scooby dooby dooby
Oh sha sha!
I am everyday people.
If you want me to stay,
I'll be around today,
to be available for you to see.
But I am about to go,
And then you'll know,
For me to stay here I got to be me.
You'll never be in doubt,
That's what it's all about,
You can't take me for granted and smile.
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
Because I promise I'll be gone for a while.
And when you see me again,
I hope that you have been,
The kind of person....that you really are now.
Got to get in straight,
How could I ever be late,
When you're my woman taking up my time.
Whoa, oh how could I ever allow,
I guess I wonder how,
I could get out a pocket for fun. HOW HOW!!
When you know that you're never number two,
Number one's gonna be number one,
ohh oww oohh
I'll be good,
I wish I could
I get this message over to you now.
ahhh, yeah, message, mmmm
When you see me again,
I hope that you have been,
The kind of person you really are now.

I'll be around today,
to be available for you to see.
But I am about to go,
And then you'll know,
For me to stay here I got to be me.
You'll never be in doubt,
That's what it's all about,
You can't take me for granted and smile.
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
Because I promise I'll be gone for a while.
And when you see me again,
I hope that you have been,
The kind of person....that you really are now.
Got to get in straight,
How could I ever be late,
When you're my woman taking up my time.
Whoa, oh how could I ever allow,
I guess I wonder how,
I could get out a pocket for fun. HOW HOW!!
When you know that you're never number two,
Number one's gonna be number one,
ohh oww oohh
I'll be good,
I wish I could
I get this message over to you now.
ahhh, yeah, message, mmmm
When you see me again,
I hope that you have been,
The kind of person you really are now.
I'll be so good, oh
I wish I could,
I get this message over to you now.
ahhh, yeah.....
End of the spring
And here she comes back.
Hi, hi, hi, hi there.
Them summer days
Those summer days
That's when I had
Most of my fun, back
Hi, hi, hi, hi there.
Them summer days
Those summer days
I cloud nine when I want to
Out of school, yeah!
County fair in the country sun
And everything is true.
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
Hot fun in the summertime.
Hot fun in the summertime.
Hot fun in the summertime.
Hot fun in the summertime.
First of the fall
And then she goes back
Bye, bye, bye, bye there.
Them summer days.
Those summer days.
Boop boop boop boop!
When I want to
Out of school
County fair in the country sun.
And everything is cool.
Ooh, yeah, yeah!
Hot fun in the summertime.
Hot fun in the summertime.
Hot fun in the summertime.
Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah, yeah
There is a blue one
Who can't accept the green one.
For living with a fat one
Trying to be a skinny one.
Different strokes
For different folks.
And so on and so on.
And scooby dooby dooby.
Oh sha sha
We got to live together!
I am no better and neither are you.
We are the same, whatever we do.
You love me, you hate me, you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah yeah.
There is a long hair
That doesn't like the short hair.
For being such a rich one
That will not help the poor one.
Different strokes
For different folks!
And so on and so on
And scooby dooby dooby
Oh sha sha
We got to live together.
There is a yellow one
That won't accept the black one.
That won't accept the red one
That won't accept the white one.
Different strokes
For different folks.
And so on and so on
And scooby dooby dooby
Oh sha sha!
I am everyday people.
If you want me to stay,
I'll be around today,
to be available for you to see.
But I am about to go,
And then you'll know,
For me to stay here I got to be me.
You'll never be in doubt,
That's what it's all about,
You can't take me for granted and smile.
Count the days I'm gone
