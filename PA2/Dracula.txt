left
munich
at

m
.,
on
1st
may
,
arriving
at
vienna
early
next
morning
should
have
arrived
at
6
46
,
but
train
was
an
hour
late
.
buda
pesth
seems
a
wonderful
place
,
from
the
glimpse
which
i
got
of
it
from
the
train
and
the
little
i
could
walk
through
the
streets
.
i
feared
to
go
very
far
from
the
station
,
as
we
had
arrived
late
and
would
start
as
near
the
correct
time
as
possible
.
the
impression
i
had
was
that
we
were
leaving
the
west
and
entering
the
east
the
most
western
of
splendid
bridges
over
the
danube
,
which
is
here
of
noble
width
and
depth
,
took
us
among
the
traditions
of
turkish
rule
.
we
left
in
pretty
good
time
,
and
came
after
nightfall
to
klausenburgh
.
here
i
stopped
for
the
night
at
the
hotel
royale
.
i
had
for
dinner
,
or
rather
supper
,
a
chicken
done
up
some
way
with
red
pepper
,
which
was
very
good
but
thirsty
.

,
get
recipe
for
mina
.
i
asked
the
waiter
,
and
he
said
it
was
called
paprika
hendl
,
and
that
,
as
it
was
a
national
dish
,
i
should
be
able
to
get
it
anywhere
along
the
carpathians
.
i
found
my
smattering
of
german
very
useful
here
indeed
,
i
don
t
know
how
i
should
be
able
to
get
on
without
it
.
having
had
some
time
at
my
disposal
when
in
london
,
i
had
visited
the
british
museum
,
and
made
search
among
the
books
and
maps
in
the
library
regarding
transylvania
it
had
struck
me
that
some
foreknowledge
of
the
country
could
hardly
fail
to
have
some
importance
in
dealing
with
a
nobleman
of
that
country
.
i
find
that
the
district
he
named
is
in
the
extreme
east
of
the
country
,
just
on
the
borders
of
three
states
,
transylvania
,
moldavia
and
bukovina
,
in
the
midst
of
the
carpathian
mountains
one
of
the
wildest
and
least
known
portions
of
europe
.
i
was
not
able
to
light
on
any
map
or
work
giving
the
exact
locality
of
the
castle
dracula
,
as
there
are
no
maps
of
this
country
as
yet
to
compare
with
our
own
ordnance
survey
maps
but
i
found
that
bistritz
,
the
post
town
named
by
count
dracula
,
is
a
fairly
well
known
place
.
i
shall
enter
here
some
of
my
notes
,
as
they
may
refresh
my
memory
when
i
talk
over
my
travels
with
mina
.
in
the
population
of
transylvania
there
are
four
distinct
nationalities
saxons
in
the
south
,
and
mixed
with
them
the
wallachs
,
who
are
the
descendants
of
the
dacians
magyars
in
the
west
,
and
szekelys
in
the
east
and
north
.
i
am
going
among
the
latter
,
who
claim
to
be
descended
from
attila
and
the
huns
.
this
may
be
so
,
for
when
the
magyars
conquered
the
country
in
the
eleventh
century
they
found
the
huns
settled
in
it
.
i
read
that
every
known
superstition
in
the
world
is
gathered
into
the
horseshoe
of
the
carpathians
,
as
if
it
were
the
centre
of
some
sort
of
imaginative
whirlpool
if
so
my
stay
may
be
very
interesting
.
mem
.
,
i
must
ask
the
count
all
about
them
.
i
did
not
sleep
well
,
though
my
bed
was
comfortable
enough
,
for
i
had
all
sorts
of
queer
dreams
.
there
was
a
dog
howling
all
night
under
my
window
,
which
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
or
it
may
have
been
the
paprika
,
for
i
had
to
drink
up
all
the
water
in
my
carafe
,
and
was
still
thirsty
.
towards
morning
i
slept
and
was
wakened
by
the
continuous
knocking
at
my
door
,
so
i
guess
i
must
have
been
sleeping
soundly
then
.
i
had
for
breakfast
more
paprika
,
and
a
sort
of
porridge
of
maize
flour
which
they
said
was
mamaliga
,
and
egg
plant
stuffed
with
forcemeat
,
a
very
excellent
dish
,
which
they
call
impletata
.
mem
.
,
get
recipe
for
this
also
.
i
had
to
hurry
breakfast
,
for
the
train
started
a
little
before
eight
,
or
rather
it
ought
to
have
done
so
,
for
after
rushing
to
the
station
at
7
30
i
had
to
sit
in
the
carriage
for
more
than
an
hour
before
we
began
to
move
.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
further
east
you
go
the
more
unpunctual
are
the
trains
.
what
ought
they
to
be
in
china
?
all
day
long
we
seemed
to
dawdle
through
a
country
which
was
full
of
beauty
of
every
kind
.
sometimes
we
saw
little
towns
or
castles
on
the
top
of
steep
hills
such
as
we
see
in
old
missals
sometimes
we
ran
by
rivers
and
streams
which
seemed
from
the
wide
stony
margin
on
each
side
of
them
to
be
subject
to
great
floods
.
it
takes
a
lot
of
water
,
and
running
strong
,
to
sweep
the
outside
edge
of
a
river
clear
.
at
every
station
there
were
groups
of
people
,
sometimes
crowds
,
and
in
all
sorts
of
attire
.
some
of
them
were
just
like
the
peasants
at
home
or
those
i
saw
coming
through
france
and
germany
,
with
short
jackets
and
round
hats
and
home
made
trousers
but
others
were
very
picturesque
.
the
women
looked
pretty
,
except
when
you
got
near
them
,
but
they
were
very
clumsy
about
the
waist
.
they
had
all
full
white
sleeves
of
some
kind
or
other
,
and
most
of
them
had
big
belts
with
a
lot
of
strips
of
something
fluttering
from
them
like
the
dresses
in
a
ballet
,
but
of
course
there
were
petticoats
under
them
.
the
strangest
figures
we
saw
were
the
slovaks
,
who
were
more
barbarian
than
the
rest
,
with
their
big
cow
boy
hats
,
great
baggy
dirty
white
trousers
,
white
linen
shirts
,
and
enormous
heavy
leather
belts
,
nearly
a
foot
wide
,
all
studded
over
with
brass
nails
.
they
wore
high
boots
,
with
their
trousers
tucked
into
them
,
and
had
long
black
hair
and
heavy
black
moustaches
.
they
are
very
picturesque
,
but
do
not
look
prepossessing
.
on
the
stage
they
would
be
set
down
at
once
as
some
old
oriental
band
of
brigands
.
they
are
,
however
,
i
am
told
,
very
harmless
and
rather
wanting
in
natural
self
assertion
.
it
was
on
the
dark
side
of
twilight
when
we
got
to
bistritz
,
which
is
a
very
interesting
old
place
.
being
practically
on
the
frontier
for
the
borgo
pass
leads
from
it
into
bukovina
it
has
had
a
very
stormy
existence
,
and
it
certainly
shows
marks
of
it
.
fifty
years
ago
a
series
of
great
fires
took
place
,
which
made
terrible
havoc
on
five
separate
occasions
.
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
underwent
a
siege
of
three
weeks
and
lost
13
,000
people
,
the
casualties
of
war
proper
being
assisted
by
famine
and
disease
.
count
dracula
had
directed
me
to
go
to
the
golden
krone
hotel
,
which
i
found
,
to
my
great
delight
,
to
be
thoroughly
old
fashioned
,
for
of
course
i
wanted
to
see
all
i
could
of
the
ways
of
the
country
.
i
was
evidently
expected
,
for
when
i
got
near
the
door
i
faced
a
cheery
looking
elderly
woman
in
the
usual
peasant
dress
white
undergarment
with
long
double
apron
,
front
,
and
back
,
of
coloured
stuff
fitting
almost
too
tight
for
modesty
.
when
i
came
close
she
bowed
and
said
,
the
herr
englishman
?
yes
,
i
said
,
jonathan
harker
.
she
smiled
,
and
gave
some
message
to
an
elderly
man
in
white
shirt
sleeves
,
who
had
followed
her
to
the
door
.
he
went
,
but
immediately
returned
with
a
letter
my
friend
.
welcome
to
the
carpathians
.
i
am
anxiously
expecting
you
.
sleep
well
to
night
.
at
three
to
morrow
the
diligence
will
start
for
bukovina
a
place
on
it
is
kept
for
you
.
at
the
borgo
pass
my
carriage
will
await
you
and
will
bring
you
to
me
.
i
trust
that
your
journey
from
london
has
been
a
happy
one
,
and
that
you
will
enjoy
your
stay
in
my
beautiful
land
.
your
friend
,
dracula
.
4
may
.
i
found
that
my
landlord
had
got
a
letter
from
the
count
,
directing
him
to
secure
the
best
place
on
the
coach
for
me
but
on
making
inquiries
as
to
details
he
seemed
somewhat
reticent
,
and
pretended
that
he
could
not
understand
my
german
.
this
could
not
be
true
,
because
up
to
then
he
had
understood
it
perfectly
at
least
,
he
answered
my
questions
exactly
as
if
he
did
.
he
and
his
wife
,
the
old
lady
who
had
received
me
,
looked
at
each
other
in
a
frightened
sort
of
way
.
he
mumbled
out
that
the
money
had
been
sent
in
a
letter
,
and
that
was
all
he
knew
.
when
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
count
dracula
,
and
could
tell
me
anything
of
his
castle
,
both
he
and
his
wife
crossed
themselves
,
and
,
saying
that
they
knew
nothing
at
all
,
simply
refused
to
speak
further
.
it
was
so
near
the
time
of
starting
that
i
had
no
time
to
ask
any
one
else
,
for
it
was
all
very
mysterious
and
not
by
any
means
comforting
.
just
before
i
was
leaving
,
the
old
lady
came
up
to
my
room
and
said
in
a
very
hysterical
way
must
you
go
?
oh
!
young
herr
,
must
you
go
?
she
was
in
such
an
excited
state
that
she
seemed
to
have
lost
her
grip
of
what
german
she
knew
,
and
mixed
it
all
up
with
some
other
language
which
i
did
not
know
at
all
.
i
was
just
able
to
follow
her
by
asking
many
questions
.
when
i
told
her
that
i
must
go
at
once
,
and
that
i
was
engaged
on
important
business
,
she
asked
again
do
you
know
what
day
it
is
?
i
answered
that
it
was
the
fourth
of
may
.
she
shook
her
head
as
she
said
again
oh
,
yes
!
i
know
that
!
i
know
that
,
but
do
you
know
what
day
it
is
?
on
my
saying
that
i
did
not
understand
,
she
went
on
it
is
the
eve
of
st
.
george
s
day
.
do
you
not
know
that
to
night
,
when
the
clock
strikes
midnight
,
all
the
evil
things
in
the
world
will
have
full
sway
?
do
you
know
where
you
are
going
,
and
what
you
are
going
to
?
she
was
in
such
evident
distress
that
i
tried
to
comfort
her
,
but
without
effect
.
finally
she
went
down
on
her
knees
and
implored
me
not
to
go
at
least
to
wait
a
day
or
two
before
starting
.
it
was
all
very
ridiculous
but
i
did
not
feel
comfortable
.
however
,
there
was
business
to
be
done
,
and
i
could
allow
nothing
to
interfere
with
it
.
i
therefore
tried
to
raise
her
up
,
and
said
,
as
gravely
as
i
could
,
that
i
thanked
her
,
but
my
duty
was
imperative
,
and
that
i
must
go
.
she
then
rose
and
dried
her
eyes
,
and
taking
a
crucifix
from
her
neck
offered
it
to
me
.
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
,
for
,
as
an
english
churchman
,
i
have
been
taught
to
regard
such
things
as
in
some
measure
idolatrous
,
and
yet
it
seemed
so
ungracious
to
refuse
an
old
lady
meaning
so
well
and
in
such
a
state
of
mind
.
she
saw
,
i
suppose
,
the
doubt
in
my
face
,
for
she
put
the
rosary
round
my
neck
,
and
said
,
for
your
mother
s
sake
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
i
am
writing
up
this
part
of
the
diary
whilst
i
am
waiting
for
the
coach
,
which
is
,
of
course
,
late
and
the
crucifix
is
still
round
my
neck
.
whether
it
is
the
old
lady
s
fear
,
or
the
many
ghostly
traditions
of
this
place
,
or
the
crucifix
itself
,
i
do
not
know
,
but
i
am
not
feeling
nearly
as
easy
in
my
mind
as
usual
.
if
this
book
should
ever
reach
mina
before
i
do
,
let
it
bring
my
good
bye
.
here
comes
the
coach
!
5
may
.
the
castle
.
the
grey
of
the
morning
has
passed
,
and
the
sun
is
high
over
the
distant
horizon
,
which
seems
jagged
,
whether
with
trees
or
hills
i
know
not
,
for
it
is
so
far
off
that
big
things
and
little
are
mixed
.
i
am
not
sleepy
,
and
,
as
i
am
not
to
be
called
till
i
awake
,
naturally
i
write
till
sleep
comes
.
there
are
many
odd
things
to
put
down
,
and
,
lest
who
reads
them
may
fancy
that
i
dined
too
well
before
i
left
bistritz
,
let
me
put
down
my
dinner
exactly
.
i
dined
on
what
they
called
robber
steak
bits
of
bacon
,
onion
,
and
beef
,
seasoned
with
red
pepper
,
and
strung
on
sticks
and
roasted
over
the
fire
,
in
the
simple
style
of
the
london
cat
s
meat
!
the
wine
was
golden
mediasch
,
which
produces
a
queer
sting
on
the
tongue
,
which
is
,
however
,
not
disagreeable
.
i
had
only
a
couple
of
glasses
of
this
,
and
nothing
else
.
when
i
got
on
the
coach
the
driver
had
not
taken
his
seat
,
and
i
saw
him
talking
with
the
landlady
.
they
were
evidently
talking
of
me
,
for
every
now
and
then
they
looked
at
me
,
and
some
of
the
people
who
were
sitting
on
the
bench
outside
the
door
which
they
call
by
a
name
meaning
word
bearer
came
and
listened
,
and
then
looked
at
me
,
most
of
them
pityingly
.
i
could
hear
a
lot
of
words
often
repeated
,
queer
words
,
for
there
were
many
nationalities
in
the
crowd
so
i
quietly
got
my
polyglot
dictionary
from
my
bag
and
looked
them
out
.
i
must
say
they
were
not
cheering
to
me
,
for
amongst
them
were
ordog
satan
,
pokol
hell
,
stregoica
witch
,
vrolok
and
vlkoslak
both
of
which
mean
the
same
thing
,
one
being
slovak
and
the
other
servian
for
something
that
is
either
were
wolf
or
vampire
.
mem
.
,
i
must
ask
the
count
about
these
superstitions
when
we
started
,
the
crowd
round
the
inn
door
,
which
had
by
this
time
swelled
to
a
considerable
size
,
all
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
pointed
two
fingers
towards
me
.
with
some
difficulty
i
got
a
fellow
passenger
to
tell
me
what
they
meant
he
would
not
answer
at
first
,
but
on
learning
that
i
was
english
,
he
explained
that
it
was
a
charm
or
guard
against
the
evil
eye
.
this
was
not
very
pleasant
for
me
,
just
starting
for
an
unknown
place
to
meet
an
unknown
man
but
every
one
seemed
so
kind
hearted
,
and
so
sorrowful
,
and
so
sympathetic
that
i
could
not
but
be
touched
.
i
shall
never
forget
the
last
glimpse
which
i
had
of
the
inn
yard
and
its
crowd
of
picturesque
figures
,
all
crossing
themselves
,
as
they
stood
round
the
wide
archway
,
with
its
background
of
rich
foliage
of
oleander
and
orange
trees
in
green
tubs
clustered
in
the
centre
of
the
yard
.
then
our
driver
,
whose
wide
linen
drawers
covered
the
whole
front
of
the
box
seat
gotza
they
call
them
cracked
his
big
whip
over
his
four
small
horses
,
which
ran
abreast
,
and
we
set
off
on
our
journey
.
i
soon
lost
sight
and
recollection
of
ghostly
fears
in
the
beauty
of
the
scene
as
we
drove
along
,
although
had
i
known
the
language
,
or
rather
languages
,
which
my
fellow
passengers
were
speaking
,
i
might
not
have
been
able
to
throw
them
off
so
easily
.
before
us
lay
a
green
sloping
land
full
of
forests
and
woods
,
with
here
and
there
steep
hills
,
crowned
with
clumps
of
trees
or
with
farmhouses
,
the
blank
gable
end
to
the
road
.
there
was
everywhere
a
bewildering
mass
of
fruit
blossom
apple
,
plum
,
pear
,
cherry
and
as
we
drove
by
i
could
see
the
green
grass
under
the
trees
spangled
with
the
fallen
petals
.
in
and
out
amongst
these
green
hills
of
what
they
call
here
the
mittel
land
ran
the
road
,
losing
itself
as
it
swept
round
the
grassy
curve
,
or
was
shut
out
by
the
straggling
ends
of
pine
woods
,
which
here
and
there
ran
down
the
hillsides
like
tongues
of
flame
.
the
road
was
rugged
,
but
still
we
seemed
to
fly
over
it
with
a
feverish
haste
.
i
could
not
understand
then
what
the
haste
meant
,
but
the
driver
was
evidently
bent
on
losing
no
time
in
reaching
borgo
prund
.
i
was
told
that
this
road
is
in
summertime
excellent
,
but
that
it
had
not
yet
been
put
in
order
after
the
winter
snows
.
in
this
respect
it
is
different
from
the
general
run
of
roads
in
the
carpathians
,
for
it
is
an
old
tradition
that
they
are
not
to
be
kept
in
too
good
order
.
of
old
the
hospadars
would
not
repair
them
,
lest
the
turk
should
think
that
they
were
preparing
to
bring
in
foreign
troops
,
and
so
hasten
the
war
which
was
always
really
at
loading
point
.
beyond
the
green
swelling
hills
of
the
mittel
land
rose
mighty
slopes
of
forest
up
to
the
lofty
steeps
of
the
carpathians
themselves
.
right
and
left
of
us
they
towered
,
with
the
afternoon
sun
falling
full
upon
them
and
bringing
out
all
the
glorious
colours
of
this
beautiful
range
,
deep
blue
and
purple
in
the
shadows
of
the
peaks
,
green
and
brown
where
grass
and
rock
mingled
,
and
an
endless
perspective
of
jagged
rock
and
pointed
crags
,
till
these
were
themselves
lost
in
the
distance
,
where
the
snowy
peaks
rose
grandly
.
here
and
there
seemed
mighty
rifts
in
the
mountains
,
through
which
,
as
the
sun
began
to
sink
,
we
saw
now
and
again
the
white
gleam
of
falling
water
.
one
of
my
companions
touched
my
arm
as
we
swept
round
the
base
of
a
hill
and
opened
up
the
lofty
,
snow
covered
peak
of
a
mountain
,
which
seemed
,
as
we
wound
on
our
serpentine
way
,
to
be
right
before
us
look
!
isten
szek
!
god
s
seat
!
and
he
crossed
himself
reverently
.
as
we
wound
on
our
endless
way
,
and
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
behind
us
,
the
shadows
of
the
evening
began
to
creep
round
us
.
this
was
emphasised
by
the
fact
that
the
snowy
mountain
top
still
held
the
sunset
,
and
seemed
to
glow
out
with
a
delicate
cool
pink
.
here
and
there
we
passed
cszeks
and
slovaks
,
all
in
picturesque
attire
,
but
i
noticed
that
goitre
was
painfully
prevalent
.
by
the
roadside
were
many
crosses
,
and
as
we
swept
by
,
my
companions
all
crossed
themselves
.
here
and
there
was
a
peasant
man
or
woman
kneeling
before
a
shrine
,
who
did
not
even
turn
round
as
we
approached
,
but
seemed
in
the
self
surrender
of
devotion
to
have
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
the
outer
world
.
there
were
many
things
new
to
me
for
instance
,
hay
ricks
in
the
trees
,
and
here
and
there
very
beautiful
masses
of
weeping
birch
,
their
white
stems
shining
like
silver
through
the
delicate
green
of
the
leaves
.
now
and
again
we
passed
a
leiter
wagon
the
ordinary
peasant
s
cart
with
its
long
,
snake
like
vertebra
,
calculated
to
suit
the
inequalities
of
the
road
.
on
this
were
sure
to
be
seated
quite
a
group
of
home
coming
peasants
,
the
cszeks
with
their
white
,
and
the
slovaks
with
their
coloured
,
sheepskins
,
the
latter
carrying
lance
fashion
their
long
staves
,
with
axe
at
end
.
as
the
evening
fell
it
began
to
get
very
cold
,
and
the
growing
twilight
seemed
to
merge
into
one
dark
mistiness
the
gloom
of
the
trees
,
oak
,
beech
,
and
pine
,
though
in
the
valleys
which
ran
deep
between
the
spurs
of
the
hills
,
as
we
ascended
through
the
pass
,
the
dark
firs
stood
out
here
and
there
against
the
background
of
late
lying
snow
.
sometimes
,
as
the
road
was
cut
through
the
pine
woods
that
seemed
in
the
darkness
to
be
closing
down
upon
us
,
great
masses
of
greyness
,
which
here
and
there
bestrewed
the
trees
,
produced
a
peculiarly
weird
and
solemn
effect
,
which
carried
on
the
thoughts
and
grim
fancies
engendered
earlier
in
the
evening
,
when
the
falling
sunset
threw
into
strange
relief
the
ghost
like
clouds
which
amongst
the
carpathians
seem
to
wind
ceaselessly
through
the
valleys
.
sometimes
the
hills
were
so
steep
that
,
despite
our
driver
s
haste
,
the
horses
could
only
go
slowly
.
i
wished
to
get
down
and
walk
up
them
,
as
we
do
at
home
,
but
the
driver
would
not
hear
of
it
.
no
,
no
,
he
said
you
must
not
walk
here
the
dogs
are
too
fierce
and
then
he
added
,
with
what
he
evidently
meant
for
grim
pleasantry
for
he
looked
round
to
catch
the
approving
smile
of
the
rest
and
you
may
have
enough
of
such
matters
before
you
go
to
sleep
.
the
only
stop
he
would
make
was
a
moment
s
pause
to
light
his
lamps
.
when
it
grew
dark
there
seemed
to
be
some
excitement
amongst
the
passengers
,
and
they
kept
speaking
to
him
,
one
after
the
other
,
as
though
urging
him
to
further
speed
.
he
lashed
the
horses
unmercifully
with
his
long
whip
,
and
with
wild
cries
of
encouragement
urged
them
on
to
further
exertions
.
then
through
the
darkness
i
could
see
a
sort
of
patch
of
grey
light
ahead
of
us
,
as
though
there
were
a
cleft
in
the
hills
.
the
excitement
of
the
passengers
grew
greater
the
crazy
coach
rocked
on
its
great
leather
springs
,
and
swayed
like
a
boat
tossed
on
a
stormy
sea
.
i
had
to
hold
on
.
the
road
grew
more
level
,
and
we
appeared
to
fly
along
.
then
the
mountains
seemed
to
come
nearer
to
us
on
each
side
and
to
frown
down
upon
us
we
were
entering
on
the
borgo
pass
.
one
by
one
several
of
the
passengers
offered
me
gifts
,
which
they
pressed
upon
me
with
an
earnestness
which
would
take
no
denial
these
were
certainly
of
an
odd
and
varied
kind
,
but
each
was
given
in
simple
good
faith
,
with
a
kindly
word
,
and
a
blessing
,
and
that
strange
mixture
of
fear
meaning
movements
which
i
had
seen
outside
the
hotel
at
bistritz
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
the
guard
against
the
evil
eye
.
then
,
as
we
flew
along
,
the
driver
leaned
forward
,
and
on
each
side
the
passengers
,
craning
over
the
edge
of
the
coach
,
peered
eagerly
into
the
darkness
.
it
was
evident
that
something
very
exciting
was
either
happening
or
expected
,
but
though
i
asked
each
passenger
,
no
one
would
give
me
the
slightest
explanation
.
this
state
of
excitement
kept
on
for
some
little
time
and
at
last
we
saw
before
us
the
pass
opening
out
on
the
eastern
side
.
there
were
dark
,
rolling
clouds
overhead
,
and
in
the
air
the
heavy
,
oppressive
sense
of
thunder
.
it
seemed
as
though
the
mountain
range
had
separated
two
atmospheres
,
and
that
now
we
had
got
into
the
thunderous
one
.
i
was
now
myself
looking
out
for
the
conveyance
which
was
to
take
me
to
the
count
.
each
moment
i
expected
to
see
the
glare
of
lamps
through
the
blackness
but
all
was
dark
.
the
only
light
was
the
flickering
rays
of
our
own
lamps
,
in
which
the
steam
from
our
hard
driven
horses
rose
in
a
white
cloud
.
we
could
see
now
the
sandy
road
lying
white
before
us
,
but
there
was
on
it
no
sign
of
a
vehicle
.
the
passengers
drew
back
with
a
sigh
of
gladness
,
which
seemed
to
mock
my
own
disappointment
.
i
was
already
thinking
what
i
had
best
do
,
when
the
driver
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
said
to
the
others
something
which
i
could
hardly
hear
,
it
was
spoken
so
quietly
and
in
so
low
a
tone
i
thought
it
was
an
hour
less
than
the
time
.
then
turning
to
me
,
he
said
in
german
worse
than
my
own
there
is
no
carriage
here
.
the
herr
is
not
expected
after
all
.
he
will
now
come
on
to
bukovina
,
and
return
to
morrow
or
the
next
day
better
the
next
day
.
whilst
he
was
speaking
the
horses
began
to
neigh
and
snort
and
plunge
wildly
,
so
that
the
driver
had
to
hold
them
up
.
then
,
amongst
a
chorus
of
screams
from
the
peasants
and
a
universal
crossing
of
themselves
,
a
cal
che
,
with
four
horses
,
drove
up
behind
us
,
overtook
us
,
and
drew
up
beside
the
coach
.
i
could
see
from
the
flash
of
our
lamps
,
as
the
rays
fell
on
them
,
that
the
horses
were
coal
black
and
splendid
animals
.
they
were
driven
by
a
tall
man
,
with
a
long
brown
beard
and
a
great
black
hat
,
which
seemed
to
hide
his
face
from
us
.
i
could
only
see
the
gleam
of
a
pair
of
very
bright
eyes
,
which
seemed
red
in
the
lamplight
,
as
he
turned
to
us
.
he
said
to
the
driver
you
are
early
to
night
,
my
friend
.
the
man
stammered
in
reply
the
english
herr
was
in
a
hurry
,
to
which
the
stranger
replied
that
is
why
,
i
suppose
,
you
wished
him
to
go
on
to
bukovina
.
you
cannot
deceive
me
,
my
friend
i
know
too
much
,
and
my
horses
are
swift
.
as
he
spoke
he
smiled
,
and
the
lamplight
fell
on
a
hard
looking
mouth
,
with
very
red
lips
and
sharp
looking
teeth
,
as
white
as
ivory
.
one
of
my
companions
whispered
to
another
the
line
from
burger
s
lenore
denn
die
todten
reiten
schnell
for
the
dead
travel
fast
.
the
strange
driver
evidently
heard
the
words
,
for
he
looked
up
with
a
gleaming
smile
.
the
passenger
turned
his
face
away
,
at
the
same
time
putting
out
his
two
fingers
and
crossing
himself
.
give
me
the
herr
s
luggage
,
said
the
driver
and
with
exceeding
alacrity
my
bags
were
handed
out
and
put
in
the
cal
che
.
then
i
descended
from
the
side
of
the
coach
,
as
the
cal
che
was
close
alongside
,
the
driver
helping
me
with
a
hand
which
caught
my
arm
in
a
grip
of
steel
his
strength
must
have
been
prodigious
.
without
a
word
he
shook
his
reins
,
the
horses
turned
,
and
we
swept
into
the
darkness
of
the
pass
.
as
i
looked
back
i
saw
the
steam
from
the
horses
of
the
coach
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
,
and
projected
against
it
the
figures
of
my
late
companions
crossing
themselves
.
then
the
driver
cracked
his
whip
and
called
to
his
horses
,
and
off
they
swept
on
their
way
to
bukovina
.
as
they
sank
into
the
darkness
i
felt
a
strange
chill
,
and
a
lonely
feeling
came
over
me
but
a
cloak
was
thrown
over
my
shoulders
,
and
a
rug
across
my
knees
,
and
the
driver
said
in
excellent
german
the
night
is
chill
,
mein
herr
,
and
my
master
the
count
bade
me
take
all
care
of
you
.
there
is
a
flask
of
slivovitz
the
plum
brandy
of
the
country
underneath
the
seat
,
if
you
should
require
it
.
i
did
not
take
any
,
but
it
was
a
comfort
to
know
it
was
there
all
the
same
.
i
felt
a
little
strangely
,
and
not
a
little
frightened
.
i
think
had
there
been
any
alternative
i
should
have
taken
it
,
instead
of
prosecuting
that
unknown
night
journey
.
the
carriage
went
at
a
hard
pace
straight
along
,
then
we
made
a
complete
turn
and
went
along
another
straight
road
.
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
simply
going
over
and
over
the
same
ground
again
and
so
i
took
note
of
some
salient
point
,
and
found
that
this
was
so
.
i
would
have
liked
to
have
asked
the
driver
what
this
all
meant
,
but
i
really
feared
to
do
so
,
for
i
thought
that
,
placed
as
i
was
,
any
protest
would
have
had
no
effect
in
case
there
had
been
an
intention
to
delay
.
by
and
by
,
however
,
as
i
was
curious
to
know
how
time
was
passing
,
i
struck
a
match
,
and
by
its
flame
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
within
a
few
minutes
of
midnight
.
this
gave
me
a
sort
of
shock
,
for
i
suppose
the
general
superstition
about
midnight
was
increased
by
my
recent
experiences
.
i
waited
with
a
sick
feeling
of
suspense
.
then
a
dog
began
to
howl
somewhere
in
a
farmhouse
far
down
the
road
a
long
,
agonised
wailing
,
as
if
from
fear
.
the
sound
was
taken
up
by
another
dog
,
and
then
another
and
another
,
till
,
borne
on
the
wind
which
now
sighed
softly
through
the
pass
,
a
wild
howling
began
,
which
seemed
to
come
from
all
over
the
country
,
as
far
as
the
imagination
could
grasp
it
through
the
gloom
of
the
night
.
at
the
first
howl
the
horses
began
to
strain
and
rear
,
but
the
driver
spoke
to
them
soothingly
,
and
they
quieted
down
,
but
shivered
and
sweated
as
though
after
a
runaway
from
sudden
fright
.
then
,
far
off
in
the
distance
,
from
the
mountains
on
each
side
of
us
began
a
louder
and
a
sharper
howling
that
of
wolves
which
affected
both
the
horses
and
myself
in
the
same
way
for
i
was
minded
to
jump
from
the
cal
che
and
run
,
whilst
they
reared
again
and
plunged
madly
,
so
that
the
driver
had
to
use
all
his
great
strength
to
keep
them
from
bolting
.
in
a
few
minutes
,
however
,
my
own
ears
got
accustomed
to
the
sound
,
and
the
horses
so
far
became
quiet
that
the
driver
was
able
to
descend
and
to
stand
before
them
.
he
petted
and
soothed
them
,
and
whispered
something
in
their
ears
,
as
i
have
heard
of
horse
tamers
doing
,
and
with
extraordinary
effect
,
for
under
his
caresses
they
became
quite
manageable
again
,
though
they
still
trembled
.
the
driver
again
took
his
seat
,
and
shaking
his
reins
,
started
off
at
a
great
pace
.
this
time
,
after
going
to
the
far
side
of
the
pass
,
he
suddenly
turned
down
a
narrow
roadway
which
ran
sharply
to
the
right
.
soon
we
were
hemmed
in
with
trees
,
which
in
places
arched
right
over
the
roadway
till
we
passed
as
through
a
tunnel
and
again
great
frowning
rocks
guarded
us
boldly
on
either
side
.
though
we
were
in
shelter
,
we
could
hear
the
rising
wind
,
for
it
moaned
and
whistled
through
the
rocks
,
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
crashed
together
as
we
swept
along
.
it
grew
colder
and
colder
still
,
and
fine
,
powdery
snow
began
to
fall
,
so
that
soon
we
and
all
around
us
were
covered
with
a
white
blanket
.
the
keen
wind
still
carried
the
howling
of
the
dogs
,
though
this
grew
fainter
as
we
went
on
our
way
.
the
baying
of
the
wolves
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
,
as
though
they
were
closing
round
on
us
from
every
side
.
i
grew
dreadfully
afraid
,
and
the
horses
shared
my
fear
.
the
driver
,
however
,
was
not
in
the
least
disturbed
he
kept
turning
his
head
to
left
and
right
,
but
i
could
not
see
anything
through
the
darkness
.
suddenly
,
away
on
our
left
,
i
saw
a
faint
flickering
blue
flame
.
the
driver
saw
it
at
the
same
moment
he
at
once
checked
the
horses
,
and
,
jumping
to
the
ground
,
disappeared
into
the
darkness
.
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
,
the
less
as
the
howling
of
the
wolves
grew
closer
but
while
i
wondered
the
driver
suddenly
appeared
again
,
and
without
a
word
took
his
seat
,
and
we
resumed
our
journey
.
i
think
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
and
kept
dreaming
of
the
incident
,
for
it
seemed
to
be
repeated
endlessly
,
and
now
looking
back
,
it
is
like
a
sort
of
awful
nightmare
.
once
the
flame
appeared
so
near
the
road
,
that
even
in
the
darkness
around
us
i
could
watch
the
driver
s
motions
.
he
went
rapidly
to
where
the
blue
flame
arose
it
must
have
been
very
faint
,
for
it
did
not
seem
to
illumine
the
place
around
it
at
all
and
gathering
a
few
stones
,
formed
them
into
some
device
.
once
there
appeared
a
strange
optical
effect
when
he
stood
between
me
and
the
flame
he
did
not
obstruct
it
,
for
i
could
see
its
ghostly
flicker
all
the
same
.
this
startled
me
,
but
as
the
effect
was
only
momentary
,
i
took
it
that
my
eyes
deceived
me
straining
through
the
darkness
.
then
for
a
time
there
were
no
blue
flames
,
and
we
sped
onwards
through
the
gloom
,
with
the
howling
of
the
wolves
around
us
,
as
though
they
were
following
in
a
moving
circle
.
at
last
there
came
a
time
when
the
driver
went
further
afield
than
he
had
yet
gone
,
and
during
his
absence
,
the
horses
began
to
tremble
worse
than
ever
and
to
snort
and
scream
with
fright
.
i
could
not
see
any
cause
for
it
,
for
the
howling
of
the
wolves
had
ceased
altogether
but
just
then
the
moon
,
sailing
through
the
black
clouds
,
appeared
behind
the
jagged
crest
of
a
beetling
,
pine
clad
rock
,
and
by
its
light
i
saw
around
us
a
ring
of
wolves
,
with
white
teeth
and
lolling
red
tongues
,
with
long
,
sinewy
limbs
and
shaggy
hair
.
they
were
a
hundred
times
more
terrible
in
the
grim
silence
which
held
them
than
even
when
they
howled
.
for
myself
,
i
felt
a
sort
of
paralysis
of
fear
.
it
is
only
when
a
man
feels
himself
face
to
face
with
such
horrors
that
he
can
understand
their
true
import
.
all
at
once
the
wolves
began
to
howl
as
though
the
moonlight
had
had
some
peculiar
effect
on
them
.
the
horses
jumped
about
and
reared
,
and
looked
helplessly
round
with
eyes
that
rolled
in
a
way
painful
to
see
but
the
living
ring
of
terror
encompassed
them
on
every
side
and
they
had
perforce
to
remain
within
it
.
i
called
to
the
coachman
to
come
,
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
only
chance
was
to
try
to
break
out
through
the
ring
and
to
aid
his
approach
.
i
shouted
and
beat
the
side
of
the
cal
che
,
hoping
by
the
noise
to
scare
the
wolves
from
that
side
,
so
as
to
give
him
a
chance
of
reaching
the
trap
.
how
he
came
there
,
i
know
not
,
but
i
heard
his
voice
raised
in
a
tone
of
imperious
command
,
and
looking
towards
the
sound
,
saw
him
stand
in
the
roadway
.
as
he
swept
his
long
arms
,
as
though
brushing
aside
some
impalpable
obstacle
,
the
wolves
fell
back
and
back
further
still
.
just
then
a
heavy
cloud
passed
across
the
face
of
the
moon
,
so
that
we
were
again
in
darkness
.
when
i
could
see
again
the
driver
was
climbing
into
the
cal
che
,
and
the
wolves
had
disappeared
.
this
was
all
so
strange
and
uncanny
that
a
dreadful
fear
came
upon
me
,
and
i
was
afraid
to
speak
or
move
.
the
time
seemed
interminable
as
we
swept
on
our
way
,
now
in
almost
complete
darkness
,
for
the
rolling
clouds
obscured
the
moon
.
we
kept
on
ascending
,
with
occasional
periods
of
quick
descent
,
but
in
the
main
always
ascending
.
suddenly
,
i
became
conscious
of
the
fact
that
the
driver
was
in
the
act
of
pulling
up
the
horses
in
the
courtyard
of
a
vast
ruined
castle
,
from
whose
tall
black
windows
came
no
ray
of
light
,
and
whose
broken
battlements
showed
a
jagged
line
against
the
moonlit
sky
.
chapter
ii
jonathan
harker
s
journal
continued
5
may
.
i
must
have
been
asleep
,
for
certainly
if
i
had
been
fully
awake
i
must
have
noticed
the
approach
of
such
a
remarkable
place
.
in
the
gloom
the
courtyard
looked
of
considerable
size
,
and
as
several
dark
ways
led
from
it
under
great
round
arches
,
it
perhaps
seemed
bigger
than
it
really
is
.
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
see
it
by
daylight
.
when
the
cal
che
stopped
,
the
driver
jumped
down
and
held
out
his
hand
to
assist
me
to
alight
.
again
i
could
not
but
notice
his
prodigious
strength
.
his
hand
actually
seemed
like
a
steel
vice
that
could
have
crushed
mine
if
he
had
chosen
.
then
he
took
out
my
traps
,
and
placed
them
on
the
ground
beside
me
as
i
stood
close
to
a
great
door
,
old
and
studded
with
large
iron
nails
,
and
set
in
a
projecting
doorway
of
massive
stone
.
i
could
see
even
in
the
dim
light
that
the
stone
was
massively
carved
,
but
that
the
carving
had
been
much
worn
by
time
and
weather
.
as
i
stood
,
the
driver
jumped
again
into
his
seat
and
shook
the
reins
the
horses
started
forward
,
and
trap
and
all
disappeared
down
one
of
the
dark
openings
.
i
stood
in
silence
where
i
was
,
for
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
of
bell
or
knocker
there
was
no
sign
through
these
frowning
walls
and
dark
window
openings
it
was
not
likely
that
my
voice
could
penetrate
.
the
time
i
waited
seemed
endless
,
and
i
felt
doubts
and
fears
crowding
upon
me
.
what
sort
of
place
had
i
come
to
,
and
among
what
kind
of
people
?
what
sort
of
grim
adventure
was
it
on
which
i
had
embarked
?
was
this
a
customary
incident
in
the
life
of
a
solicitor
s
clerk
sent
out
to
explain
the
purchase
of
a
london
estate
to
a
foreigner
?
solicitor
s
clerk
!
mina
would
not
like
that
.
solicitor
for
just
before
leaving
london
i
got
word
that
my
examination
was
successful
and
i
am
now
a
full
blown
solicitor
!
i
began
to
rub
my
eyes
and
pinch
myself
to
see
if
i
were
awake
.
it
all
seemed
like
a
horrible
nightmare
to
me
,
and
i
expected
that
i
should
suddenly
awake
,
and
find
myself
at
home
,
with
the
dawn
struggling
in
through
the
windows
,
as
i
had
now
and
again
felt
in
the
morning
after
a
day
of
overwork
.
but
my
flesh
answered
the
pinching
test
,
and
my
eyes
were
not
to
be
deceived
.
i
was
indeed
awake
and
among
the
carpathians
.
all
i
could
do
now
was
to
be
patient
,
and
to
wait
the
coming
of
the
morning
.
just
as
i
had
come
to
this
conclusion
i
heard
a
heavy
step
approaching
behind
the
great
door
,
and
saw
through
the
chinks
the
gleam
of
a
coming
light
.
then
there
was
the
sound
of
rattling
chains
and
the
clanking
of
massive
bolts
drawn
back
.
a
key
was
turned
with
the
loud
grating
noise
of
long
disuse
,
and
the
great
door
swung
back
.
within
,
stood
a
tall
old
man
,
clean
shaven
save
for
a
long
white
moustache
,
and
clad
in
black
from
head
to
foot
,
without
a
single
speck
of
colour
about
him
anywhere
.
he
held
in
his
hand
an
antique
silver
lamp
,
in
which
the
flame
burned
without
chimney
or
globe
of
any
kind
,
throwing
long
quivering
shadows
as
it
flickered
in
the
draught
of
the
open
door
.
the
old
man
motioned
me
in
with
his
right
hand
with
a
courtly
gesture
,
saying
in
excellent
english
,
but
with
a
strange
intonation
welcome
to
my
house
!
enter
freely
and
of
your
own
will
!
he
made
no
motion
of
stepping
to
meet
me
,
but
stood
like
a
statue
,
as
though
his
gesture
of
welcome
had
fixed
him
into
stone
.
the
instant
,
however
,
that
i
had
stepped
over
the
threshold
,
he
moved
impulsively
forward
,
and
holding
out
his
hand
grasped
mine
with
a
strength
which
made
me
wince
,
an
effect
which
was
not
lessened
by
the
fact
that
it
seemed
as
cold
as
ice
more
like
the
hand
of
a
dead
than
a
living
man
.
again
he
said
welcome
to
my
house
.
come
freely
.
go
safely
and
leave
something
of
the
happiness
you
bring
!
the
strength
of
the
handshake
was
so
much
akin
to
that
which
i
had
noticed
in
the
driver
,
whose
face
i
had
not
seen
,
that
for
a
moment
i
doubted
if
it
were
not
the
same
person
to
whom
i
was
speaking
so
to
make
sure
,
i
said
interrogatively
count
dracula
?
he
bowed
in
a
courtly
way
as
he
replied
i
am
dracula
and
i
bid
you
welcome
,
mr
.
harker
,
to
my
house
.
come
in
the
night
air
is
chill
,
and
you
must
need
to
eat
and
rest
.
as
he
was
speaking
,
he
put
the
lamp
on
a
bracket
on
the
wall
,
and
stepping
out
,
took
my
luggage
he
had
carried
it
in
before
i
could
forestall
him
.
i
protested
but
he
insisted
nay
,
sir
,
you
are
my
guest
.
it
is
late
,
and
my
people
are
not
available
.
let
me
see
to
your
comfort
myself
.
he
insisted
on
carrying
my
traps
along
the
passage
,
and
then
up
a
great
winding
stair
,
and
along
another
great
passage
,
on
whose
stone
floor
our
steps
rang
heavily
.
at
the
end
of
this
he
threw
open
a
heavy
door
,
and
i
rejoiced
to
see
within
a
well
lit
room
in
which
a
table
was
spread
for
supper
,
and
on
whose
mighty
hearth
a
great
fire
of
logs
,
freshly
replenished
,
flamed
and
flared
.
the
count
halted
,
putting
down
my
bags
,
closed
the
door
,
and
crossing
the
room
,
opened
another
door
,
which
led
into
a
small
octagonal
room
lit
by
a
single
lamp
,
and
seemingly
without
a
window
of
any
sort
.
passing
through
this
,
he
opened
another
door
,
and
motioned
me
to
enter
.
it
was
a
welcome
sight
for
here
was
a
great
bedroom
well
lighted
and
warmed
with
another
log
fire
,
also
added
to
but
lately
,
for
the
top
logs
were
fresh
which
sent
a
hollow
roar
up
the
wide
chimney
.
the
count
himself
left
my
luggage
inside
and
withdrew
,
saying
,
before
he
closed
the
door
you
will
need
,
after
your
journey
,
to
refresh
yourself
by
making
your
toilet
.
i
trust
you
will
find
all
you
wish
.
when
you
are
ready
,
come
into
the
other
room
,
where
you
will
find
your
supper
prepared
.
the
light
and
warmth
and
the
count
s
courteous
welcome
seemed
to
have
dissipated
all
my
doubts
and
fears
.
having
then
reached
my
normal
state
,
i
discovered
that
i
was
half
famished
with
hunger
so
making
a
hasty
toilet
,
i
went
into
the
other
room
.
i
found
supper
already
laid
out
.
my
host
,
who
stood
on
one
side
of
the
great
fireplace
,
leaning
against
the
stonework
,
made
a
graceful
wave
of
his
hand
to
the
table
,
and
said
i
pray
you
,
be
seated
and
sup
how
you
please
.
you
will
,
i
trust
,
excuse
me
that
i
do
not
join
you
but
i
have
dined
already
,
and
i
do
not
sup
.
i
handed
to
him
the
sealed
letter
which
mr
.
hawkins
had
entrusted
to
me
.
he
opened
it
and
read
it
gravely
then
,
with
a
charming
smile
,
he
handed
it
to
me
to
read
.
one
passage
of
it
,
at
least
,
gave
me
a
thrill
of
pleasure
.
i
must
regret
that
an
attack
of
gout
,
from
which
malady
i
am
a
constant
sufferer
,
forbids
absolutely
any
travelling
on
my
part
for
some
time
to
come
but
i
am
happy
to
say
i
can
send
a
sufficient
substitute
,
one
in
whom
i
have
every
possible
confidence
.
he
is
a
young
man
,
full
of
energy
and
talent
in
his
own
way
,
and
of
a
very
faithful
disposition
.
he
is
discreet
and
silent
,
and
has
grown
into
manhood
in
my
service
.
he
shall
be
ready
to
attend
on
you
when
you
will
during
his
stay
,
and
shall
take
your
instructions
in
all
matters
.
the
count
himself
came
forward
and
took
off
the
cover
of
a
dish
,
and
i
fell
to
at
once
on
an
excellent
roast
chicken
.
this
,
with
some
cheese
and
a
salad
and
a
bottle
of
old
tokay
,
of
which
i
had
two
glasses
,
was
my
supper
.
during
the
time
i
was
eating
it
the
count
asked
me
many
questions
as
to
my
journey
,
and
i
told
him
by
degrees
all
i
had
experienced
.
by
this
time
i
had
finished
my
supper
,
and
by
my
host
s
desire
had
drawn
up
a
chair
by
the
fire
and
begun
to
smoke
a
cigar
which
he
offered
me
,
at
the
same
time
excusing
himself
that
he
did
not
smoke
.
i
had
now
an
opportunity
of
observing
him
,
and
found
him
of
a
very
marked
physiognomy
.
his
face
was
a
strong
a
very
strong
aquiline
,
with
high
bridge
of
the
thin
nose
and
peculiarly
arched
nostrils
with
lofty
domed
forehead
,
and
hair
growing
scantily
round
the
temples
but
profusely
elsewhere
.
his
eyebrows
were
very
massive
,
almost
meeting
over
the
nose
,
and
with
bushy
hair
that
seemed
to
curl
in
its
own
profusion
.
the
mouth
,
so
far
as
i
could
see
it
under
the
heavy
moustache
,
was
fixed
and
rather
cruel
looking
,
with
peculiarly
sharp
white
teeth
these
protruded
over
the
lips
,
whose
remarkable
ruddiness
showed
astonishing
vitality
in
a
man
of
his
years
.
for
the
rest
,
his
ears
were
pale
,
and
at
the
tops
extremely
pointed
the
chin
was
broad
and
strong
,
and
the
cheeks
firm
though
thin
.
the
general
effect
was
one
of
extraordinary
pallor
.
hitherto
i
had
noticed
the
backs
of
his
hands
as
they
lay
on
his
knees
in
the
firelight
,
and
they
had
seemed
rather
white
and
fine
but
seeing
them
now
close
to
me
,
i
could
not
but
notice
that
they
were
rather
coarse
broad
,
with
squat
fingers
.
strange
to
say
,
there
were
hairs
in
the
centre
of
the
palm
.
the
nails
were
long
and
fine
,
and
cut
to
a
sharp
point
.
as
the
count
leaned
over
me
and
his
hands
touched
me
,
i
could
not
repress
a
shudder
.
it
may
have
been
that
his
breath
was
rank
,
but
a
horrible
feeling
of
nausea
came
over
me
,
which
,
do
what
i
would
,
i
could
not
conceal
.
the
count
,
evidently
noticing
it
,
drew
back
and
with
a
grim
sort
of
smile
,
which
showed
more
than
he
had
yet
done
his
protuberant
teeth
,
sat
himself
down
again
on
his
own
side
of
the
fireplace
.
we
were
both
silent
for
a
while
and
as
i
looked
towards
the
window
i
saw
the
first
dim
streak
of
the
coming
dawn
.
there
seemed
a
strange
stillness
over
everything
but
as
i
listened
i
heard
as
if
from
down
below
in
the
valley
the
howling
of
many
wolves
.
the
count
s
eyes
gleamed
,
and
he
said
listen
to
them
the
children
of
the
night
.
what
music
they
make
!
seeing
,
i
suppose
,
some
expression
in
my
face
strange
to
him
,
he
added
ah
,
sir
,
you
dwellers
in
the
city
cannot
enter
into
the
feelings
of
the
hunter
.
then
he
rose
and
said
but
you
must
be
tired
.
your
bedroom
is
all
ready
,
and
to
morrow
you
shall
sleep
as
late
as
you
will
.
i
have
to
be
away
till
the
afternoon
so
sleep
well
and
dream
well
!
with
a
courteous
bow
,
he
opened
for
me
himself
the
door
to
the
octagonal
room
,
and
i
entered
my
bedroom
....
i
am
all
in
a
sea
of
wonders
.
i
doubt
i
fear
i
think
strange
things
,
which
i
dare
not
confess
to
my
own
soul
.
god
keep
me
,
if
only
for
the
sake
of
those
dear
to
me
!
7
may
.
it
is
again
early
morning
,
but
i
have
rested
and
enjoyed
the
last
twenty
four
hours
.
i
slept
till
late
in
the
day
,
and
awoke
of
my
own
accord
.
when
i
had
dressed
myself
i
went
into
the
room
where
we
had
supped
,
and
found
a
cold
breakfast
laid
out
,
with
coffee
kept
hot
by
the
pot
being
placed
on
the
hearth
.
there
was
a
card
on
the
table
,
on
which
was
written
i
have
to
be
absent
for
a
while
.
do
not
wait
for
me
.
d
.
i
set
to
and
enjoyed
a
hearty
meal
.
when
i
had
done
,
i
looked
for
a
bell
,
so
that
i
might
let
the
servants
know
i
had
finished
but
i
could
not
find
one
.
there
are
certainly
odd
deficiencies
in
the
house
,
considering
the
extraordinary
evidences
of
wealth
which
are
round
me
.
the
table
service
is
of
gold
,
and
so
beautifully
wrought
that
it
must
be
of
immense
value
.
the
curtains
and
upholstery
of
the
chairs
and
sofas
and
the
hangings
of
my
bed
are
of
the
costliest
and
most
beautiful
fabrics
,
and
must
have
been
of
fabulous
value
when
they
were
made
,
for
they
are
centuries
old
,
though
in
excellent
order
.
i
saw
something
like
them
in
hampton
court
,
but
there
they
were
worn
and
frayed
and
moth
eaten
.
but
still
in
none
of
the
rooms
is
there
a
mirror
.
there
is
not
even
a
toilet
glass
on
my
table
,
and
i
had
to
get
the
little
shaving
glass
from
my
bag
before
i
could
either
shave
or
brush
my
hair
.
i
have
not
yet
seen
a
servant
anywhere
,
or
heard
a
sound
near
the
castle
except
the
howling
of
wolves
.
some
time
after
i
had
finished
my
meal
i
do
not
know
whether
to
call
it
breakfast
or
dinner
,
for
it
was
between
five
and
six
o
clock
when
i
had
it
i
looked
about
for
something
to
read
,
for
i
did
not
like
to
go
about
the
castle
until
i
had
asked
the
count
s
permission
.
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
room
,
book
,
newspaper
,
or
even
writing
materials
so
i
opened
another
door
in
the
room
and
found
a
sort
of
library
.
the
door
opposite
mine
i
tried
,
but
found
it
locked
.
in
the
library
i
found
,
to
my
great
delight
,
a
vast
number
of
english
books
,
whole
shelves
full
of
them
,
and
bound
volumes
of
magazines
and
newspapers
.
a
table
in
the
centre
was
littered
with
english
magazines
and
newspapers
,
though
none
of
them
were
of
very
recent
date
.
the
books
were
of
the
most
varied
kind
history
,
geography
,
politics
,
political
economy
,
botany
,
geology
,
law
all
relating
to
england
and
english
life
and
customs
and
manners
.
there
were
even
such
books
of
reference
as
the
london
directory
,
the
red
and
blue
books
,
whitaker
s
almanac
,
the
army
and
navy
lists
,
and
it
somehow
gladdened
my
heart
to
see
it
the
law
list
.
whilst
i
was
looking
at
the
books
,
the
door
opened
,
and
the
count
entered
.
he
saluted
me
in
a
hearty
way
,
and
hoped
that
i
had
had
a
good
night
s
rest
.
then
he
went
on
i
am
glad
you
found
your
way
in
here
,
for
i
am
sure
there
is
much
that
will
interest
you
.
these
companions
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
some
of
the
books
have
been
good
friends
to
me
,
and
for
some
years
past
,
ever
since
i
had
the
idea
of
going
to
london
,
have
given
me
many
,
many
hours
of
pleasure
.
through
them
i
have
come
to
know
your
great
england
and
to
know
her
is
to
love
her
.
i
long
to
go
through
the
crowded
streets
of
your
mighty
london
,
to
be
in
the
midst
of
the
whirl
and
rush
of
humanity
,
to
share
its
life
,
its
change
,
its
death
,
and
all
that
makes
it
what
it
is
.
but
alas
!
as
yet
i
only
know
your
tongue
through
books
.
to
you
,
my
friend
,
i
look
that
i
know
it
to
speak
.
but
,
count
,
i
said
,
you
know
and
speak
english
thoroughly
!
he
bowed
gravely
.
i
thank
you
,
my
friend
,
for
your
all
too
flattering
estimate
,
but
yet
i
fear
that
i
am
but
a
little
way
on
the
road
i
would
travel
.
true
,
i
know
the
grammar
and
the
words
,
but
yet
i
know
not
how
to
speak
them
.
indeed
,
i
said
,
you
speak
excellently
.
not
so
,
he
answered
.
well
,
i
know
that
,
did
i
move
and
speak
in
your
london
,
none
there
are
who
would
not
know
me
for
a
stranger
.
that
is
not
enough
for
me
.
here
i
am
noble
i
am
boyar
the
common
people
know
me
,
and
i
am
master
.
but
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
,
he
is
no
one
men
know
him
not
and
to
know
not
is
to
care
not
for
.
i
am
content
if
i
am
like
the
rest
,
so
that
no
man
stops
if
he
see
me
,
or
pause
in
his
speaking
if
he
hear
my
words
,
ha
,
ha
!
a
stranger
!
i
have
been
so
long
master
that
i
would
be
master
still
or
at
least
that
none
other
should
be
master
of
me
.
you
come
to
me
not
alone
as
agent
of
my
friend
peter
hawkins
,
of
exeter
,
to
tell
me
all
about
my
new
estate
in
london
.
you
shall
,
i
trust
,
rest
here
with
me
awhile
,
so
that
by
our
talking
i
may
learn
the
english
intonation
and
i
would
that
you
tell
me
when
i
make
error
,
even
of
the
smallest
,
in
my
speaking
.
i
am
sorry
that
i
had
to
be
away
so
long
to
day
but
you
will
,
i
know
,
forgive
one
who
has
so
many
important
affairs
in
hand
.
of
course
i
said
all
i
could
about
being
willing
,
and
asked
if
i
might
come
into
that
room
when
i
chose
.
he
answered
yes
,
certainly
,
and
added
you
may
go
anywhere
you
wish
in
the
castle
,
except
where
the
doors
are
locked
,
where
of
course
you
will
not
wish
to
go
.
there
is
reason
that
all
things
are
as
they
are
,
and
did
you
see
with
my
eyes
and
know
with
my
knowledge
,
you
would
perhaps
better
understand
.
i
said
i
was
sure
of
this
,
and
then
he
went
on
we
are
in
transylvania
and
transylvania
is
not
england
.
our
ways
are
not
your
ways
,
and
there
shall
be
to
you
many
strange
things
.
nay
,
from
what
you
have
told
me
of
your
experiences
already
,
you
know
something
of
what
strange
things
there
may
be
.
this
led
to
much
conversation
and
as
it
was
evident
that
he
wanted
to
talk
,
if
only
for
talking
s
sake
,
i
asked
him
many
questions
regarding
things
that
had
already
happened
to
me
or
come
within
my
notice
.
sometimes
he
sheered
off
the
subject
,
or
turned
the
conversation
by
pretending
not
to
understand
but
generally
he
answered
all
i
asked
most
frankly
.
then
as
time
went
on
,
and
i
had
got
somewhat
bolder
,
i
asked
him
of
some
of
the
strange
things
of
the
preceding
night
,
as
,
for
instance
,
why
the
coachman
went
to
the
places
where
he
had
seen
the
blue
flames
.
he
then
explained
to
me
that
it
was
commonly
believed
that
on
a
certain
night
of
the
year
last
night
,
in
fact
,
when
all
evil
spirits
are
supposed
to
have
unchecked
sway
a
blue
flame
is
seen
over
any
place
where
treasure
has
been
concealed
.
that
treasure
has
been
hidden
,
he
went
on
,
in
the
region
through
which
you
came
last
night
,
there
can
be
but
little
doubt
for
it
was
the
ground
fought
over
for
centuries
by
the
wallachian
,
the
saxon
,
and
the
turk
.
why
,
there
is
hardly
a
foot
of
soil
in
all
this
region
that
has
not
been
enriched
by
the
blood
of
men
,
patriots
or
invaders
.
in
old
days
there
were
stirring
times
,
when
the
austrian
and
the
hungarian
came
up
in
hordes
,
and
the
patriots
went
out
to
meet
them
men
and
women
,
the
aged
and
the
children
too
and
waited
their
coming
on
the
rocks
above
the
passes
,
that
they
might
sweep
destruction
on
them
with
their
artificial
avalanches
.
when
the
invader
was
triumphant
he
found
but
little
,
for
whatever
there
was
had
been
sheltered
in
the
friendly
soil
.
but
how
,
said
i
,
can
it
have
remained
so
long
undiscovered
,
when
there
is
a
sure
index
to
it
if
men
will
but
take
the
trouble
to
look
?
the
count
smiled
,
and
as
his
lips
ran
back
over
his
gums
,
the
long
,
sharp
,
canine
teeth
showed
out
strangely
he
answered
because
your
peasant
is
at
heart
a
coward
and
a
fool
!
those
flames
only
appear
on
one
night
and
on
that
night
no
man
of
this
land
will
,
if
he
can
help
it
,
stir
without
his
doors
.
and
,
dear
sir
,
even
if
he
did
he
would
not
know
what
to
do
.
why
,
even
the
peasant
that
you
tell
me
of
who
marked
the
place
of
the
flame
would
not
know
where
to
look
in
daylight
even
for
his
own
work
.
even
you
would
not
,
i
dare
be
sworn
,
be
able
to
find
these
places
again
?
there
you
are
right
,
i
said
.
i
know
no
more
than
the
dead
where
even
to
look
for
them
.
then
we
drifted
into
other
matters
.
come
,
he
said
at
last
,
tell
me
of
london
and
of
the
house
which
you
have
procured
for
me
.
with
an
apology
for
my
remissness
,
i
went
into
my
own
room
to
get
the
papers
from
my
bag
.
whilst
i
was
placing
them
in
order
i
heard
a
rattling
of
china
and
silver
in
the
next
room
,
and
as
i
passed
through
,
noticed
that
the
table
had
been
cleared
and
the
lamp
lit
,
for
it
was
by
this
time
deep
into
the
dark
.
the
lamps
were
also
lit
in
the
study
or
library
,
and
i
found
the
count
lying
on
the
sofa
,
reading
,
of
all
things
in
the
world
,
an
english
bradshaw
s
guide
.
when
i
came
in
he
cleared
the
books
and
papers
from
the
table
and
with
him
i
went
into
plans
and
deeds
and
figures
of
all
sorts
.
he
was
interested
in
everything
,
and
asked
me
a
myriad
questions
about
the
place
and
its
surroundings
.
he
clearly
had
studied
beforehand
all
he
could
get
on
the
subject
of
the
neighbourhood
,
for
he
evidently
at
the
end
knew
very
much
more
than
i
did
.
when
i
remarked
this
,
he
answered
well
,
but
,
my
friend
,
is
it
not
needful
that
i
should
?
when
i
go
there
i
shall
be
all
alone
,
and
my
friend
harker
jonathan
nay
,
pardon
me
,
i
fall
into
my
country
s
habit
of
putting
your
patronymic
first
my
friend
jonathan
harker
will
not
be
by
my
side
to
correct
and
aid
me
.
he
will
be
in
exeter
,
miles
away
,
probably
working
at
papers
of
the
law
with
my
other
friend
,
peter
hawkins
.
so
!
we
went
thoroughly
into
the
business
of
the
purchase
of
the
estate
at
purfleet
.
when
i
had
told
him
the
facts
and
got
his
signature
to
the
necessary
papers
,
and
had
written
a
letter
with
them
ready
to
post
to
mr
.
hawkins
,
he
began
to
ask
me
how
i
had
come
across
so
suitable
a
place
.
i
read
to
him
the
notes
which
i
had
made
at
the
time
,
and
which
i
inscribe
here
at
purfleet
,
on
a
by
road
,
i
came
across
just
such
a
place
as
seemed
to
be
required
,
and
where
was
displayed
a
dilapidated
notice
that
the
place
was
for
sale
.
it
is
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
,
of
ancient
structure
,
built
of
heavy
stones
,
and
has
not
been
repaired
for
a
large
number
of
years
.
the
closed
gates
are
of
heavy
old
oak
and
iron
,
all
eaten
with
rust
.
the
estate
is
called
carfax
,
no
doubt
a
corruption
of
the
old
quatre
face
,
as
the
house
is
four
sided
,
agreeing
with
the
cardinal
points
of
the
compass
.
it
contains
in
all
some
twenty
acres
,
quite
surrounded
by
the
solid
stone
wall
above
mentioned
.
there
are
many
trees
on
it
,
which
make
it
in
places
gloomy
,
and
there
is
a
deep
,
dark
looking
pond
or
small
lake
,
evidently
fed
by
some
springs
,
as
the
water
is
clear
and
flows
away
in
a
fair
sized
stream
.
the
house
is
very
large
and
of
all
periods
back
,
i
should
say
,
to
medi
val
times
,
for
one
part
is
of
stone
immensely
thick
,
with
only
a
few
windows
high
up
and
heavily
barred
with
iron
.
it
looks
like
part
of
a
keep
,
and
is
close
to
an
old
chapel
or
church
.
i
could
not
enter
it
,
as
i
had
not
the
key
of
the
door
leading
to
it
from
the
house
,
but
i
have
taken
with
my
kodak
views
of
it
from
various
points
.
the
house
has
been
added
to
,
but
in
a
very
straggling
way
,
and
i
can
only
guess
at
the
amount
of
ground
it
covers
,
which
must
be
very
great
.
there
are
but
few
houses
close
at
hand
,
one
being
a
very
large
house
only
recently
added
to
and
formed
into
a
private
lunatic
asylum
.
it
is
not
,
however
,
visible
from
the
grounds
.
when
i
had
finished
,
he
said
i
am
glad
that
it
is
old
and
big
.
i
myself
am
of
an
old
family
,
and
to
live
in
a
new
house
would
kill
me
.
a
house
cannot
be
made
habitable
in
a
day
and
,
after
all
,
how
few
days
go
to
make
up
a
century
.
i
rejoice
also
that
there
is
a
chapel
of
old
times
.
we
transylvanian
nobles
love
not
to
think
that
our
bones
may
lie
amongst
the
common
dead
.
i
seek
not
gaiety
nor
mirth
,
not
the
bright
voluptuousness
of
much
sunshine
and
sparkling
waters
which
please
the
young
and
gay
.
i
am
no
longer
young
and
my
heart
,
through
weary
years
of
mourning
over
the
dead
,
is
not
attuned
to
mirth
.
moreover
,
the
walls
of
my
castle
are
broken
the
shadows
are
many
,
and
the
wind
breathes
cold
through
the
broken
battlements
and
casements
.
i
love
the
shade
and
the
shadow
,
and
would
be
alone
with
my
thoughts
when
i
may
.
somehow
his
words
and
his
look
did
not
seem
to
accord
,
or
else
it
was
that
his
cast
of
face
made
his
smile
look
malignant
and
saturnine
.
presently
,
with
an
excuse
,
he
left
me
,
asking
me
to
put
all
my
papers
together
.
he
was
some
little
time
away
,
and
i
began
to
look
at
some
of
the
books
around
me
.
one
was
an
atlas
,
which
i
found
opened
naturally
at
england
,
as
if
that
map
had
been
much
used
.
on
looking
at
it
i
found
in
certain
places
little
rings
marked
,
and
on
examining
these
i
noticed
that
one
was
near
london
on
the
east
side
,
manifestly
where
his
new
estate
was
situated
the
other
two
were
exeter
,
and
whitby
on
the
yorkshire
coast
.
it
was
the
better
part
of
an
hour
when
the
count
returned
.
aha
!
he
said
still
at
your
books
?
good
!
but
you
must
not
work
always
.
come
i
am
informed
that
your
supper
is
ready
.
he
took
my
arm
,
and
we
went
into
the
next
room
,
where
i
found
an
excellent
supper
ready
on
the
table
.
the
count
again
excused
himself
,
as
he
had
dined
out
on
his
being
away
from
home
.
but
he
sat
as
on
the
previous
night
,
and
chatted
whilst
i
ate
.
after
supper
i
smoked
,
as
on
the
last
evening
,
and
the
count
stayed
with
me
,
chatting
and
asking
questions
on
every
conceivable
subject
,
hour
after
hour
.
i
felt
that
it
was
getting
very
late
indeed
,
but
i
did
not
say
anything
,
for
i
felt
under
obligation
to
meet
my
host
s
wishes
in
every
way
.
i
was
not
sleepy
,
as
the
long
sleep
yesterday
had
fortified
me
but
i
could
not
help
experiencing
that
chill
which
comes
over
one
at
the
coming
of
the
dawn
,
which
is
like
,
in
its
way
,
the
turn
of
the
tide
.
they
say
that
people
who
are
near
death
die
generally
at
the
change
to
the
dawn
or
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
any
one
who
has
when
tired
,
and
tied
as
it
were
to
his
post
,
experienced
this
change
in
the
atmosphere
can
well
believe
it
.
all
at
once
we
heard
the
crow
of
a
cock
coming
up
with
preternatural
shrillness
through
the
clear
morning
air
count
dracula
,
jumping
to
his
feet
,
said
why
,
there
is
the
morning
again
!
how
remiss
i
am
to
let
you
stay
up
so
long
.
you
must
make
your
conversation
regarding
my
dear
new
country
of
england
less
interesting
,
so
that
i
may
not
forget
how
time
flies
by
us
,
and
,
with
a
courtly
bow
,
he
quickly
left
me
.
i
went
into
my
own
room
and
drew
the
curtains
,
but
there
was
little
to
notice
my
window
opened
into
the
courtyard
,
all
i
could
see
was
the
warm
grey
of
quickening
sky
.
so
i
pulled
the
curtains
again
,
and
have
written
of
this
day
.
8
may
.
i
began
to
fear
as
i
wrote
in
this
book
that
i
was
getting
too
diffuse
but
now
i
am
glad
that
i
went
into
detail
from
the
first
,
for
there
is
something
so
strange
about
this
place
and
all
in
it
that
i
cannot
but
feel
uneasy
.
i
wish
i
were
safe
out
of
it
,
or
that
i
had
never
come
.
it
may
be
that
this
strange
night
existence
is
telling
on
me
but
would
that
that
were
all
!
if
there
were
any
one
to
talk
to
i
could
bear
it
,
but
there
is
no
one
.
i
have
only
the
count
to
speak
with
,
and
he
!
i
fear
i
am
myself
the
only
living
soul
within
the
place
.
let
me
be
prosaic
so
far
as
facts
can
be
it
will
help
me
to
bear
up
,
and
imagination
must
not
run
riot
with
me
.
if
it
does
i
am
lost
.
let
me
say
at
once
how
i
stand
or
seem
to
.
i
only
slept
a
few
hours
when
i
went
to
bed
,
and
feeling
that
i
could
not
sleep
any
more
,
got
up
.
i
had
hung
my
shaving
glass
by
the
window
,
and
was
just
beginning
to
shave
.
suddenly
i
felt
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
heard
the
count
s
voice
saying
to
me
,
good
morning
.
i
started
,
for
it
amazed
me
that
i
had
not
seen
him
,
since
the
reflection
of
the
glass
covered
the
whole
room
behind
me
.
in
starting
i
had
cut
myself
slightly
,
but
did
not
notice
it
at
the
moment
.
having
answered
the
count
s
salutation
,
i
turned
to
the
glass
again
to
see
how
i
had
been
mistaken
.
this
time
there
could
be
no
error
,
for
the
man
was
close
to
me
,
and
i
could
see
him
over
my
shoulder
.
but
there
was
no
reflection
of
him
in
the
mirror
!
the
whole
room
behind
me
was
displayed
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
man
in
it
,
except
myself
.
this
was
startling
,
and
,
coming
on
the
top
of
so
many
strange
things
,
was
beginning
to
increase
that
vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
which
i
always
have
when
the
count
is
near
but
at
the
instant
i
saw
that
the
cut
had
bled
a
little
,
and
the
blood
was
trickling
over
my
chin
.
i
laid
down
the
razor
,
turning
as
i
did
so
half
round
to
look
for
some
sticking
plaster
.
when
the
count
saw
my
face
,
his
eyes
blazed
with
a
sort
of
demoniac
fury
,
and
he
suddenly
made
a
grab
at
my
throat
.
i
drew
away
,
and
his
hand
touched
the
string
of
beads
which
held
the
crucifix
.
it
made
an
instant
change
in
him
,
for
the
fury
passed
so
quickly
that
i
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
ever
there
.
take
care
,
he
said
,
take
care
how
you
cut
yourself
.
it
is
more
dangerous
than
you
think
in
this
country
.
then
seizing
the
shaving
glass
,
he
went
on
and
this
is
the
wretched
thing
that
has
done
the
mischief
.
it
is
a
foul
bauble
of
man
s
vanity
.
away
with
it
!
and
opening
the
heavy
window
with
one
wrench
of
his
terrible
hand
,
he
flung
out
the
glass
,
which
was
shattered
into
a
thousand
pieces
on
the
stones
of
the
courtyard
far
below
.
then
he
withdrew
without
a
word
.
it
is
very
annoying
,
for
i
do
not
see
how
i
am
to
shave
,
unless
in
my
watch
case
or
the
bottom
of
the
shaving
pot
,
which
is
fortunately
of
metal
.
when
i
went
into
the
dining
room
,
breakfast
was
prepared
but
i
could
not
find
the
count
anywhere
.
so
i
breakfasted
alone
.
it
is
strange
that
as
yet
i
have
not
seen
the
count
eat
or
drink
.
he
must
be
a
very
peculiar
man
!
after
breakfast
i
did
a
little
exploring
in
the
castle
.
i
went
out
on
the
stairs
,
and
found
a
room
looking
towards
the
south
.
the
view
was
magnificent
,
and
from
where
i
stood
there
was
every
opportunity
of
seeing
it
.
the
castle
is
on
the
very
edge
of
a
terrible
precipice
.
a
stone
falling
from
the
window
would
fall
a
thousand
feet
without
touching
anything
!
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
is
a
sea
of
green
tree
tops
,
with
occasionally
a
deep
rift
where
there
is
a
chasm
.
here
and
there
are
silver
threads
where
the
rivers
wind
in
deep
gorges
through
the
forests
.
but
i
am
not
in
heart
to
describe
beauty
,
for
when
i
had
seen
the
view
i
explored
further
doors
,
doors
,
doors
everywhere
,
and
all
locked
and
bolted
.
in
no
place
save
from
the
windows
in
the
castle
walls
is
there
an
available
exit
.
the
castle
is
a
veritable
prison
,
and
i
am
a
prisoner
!
chapter
iii
jonathan
harker
s
journal
continued
when
i
found
that
i
was
a
prisoner
a
sort
of
wild
feeling
came
over
me
.
i
rushed
up
and
down
the
stairs
,
trying
every
door
and
peering
out
of
every
window
i
could
find
but
after
a
little
the
conviction
of
my
helplessness
overpowered
all
other
feelings
.
when
i
look
back
after
a
few
hours
i
think
i
must
have
been
mad
for
the
time
,
for
i
behaved
much
as
a
rat
does
in
a
trap
.
when
,
however
,
the
conviction
had
come
to
me
that
i
was
helpless
i
sat
down
quietly
as
quietly
as
i
have
ever
done
anything
in
my
life
and
began
to
think
over
what
was
best
to
be
done
.
i
am
thinking
still
,
and
as
yet
have
come
to
no
definite
conclusion
.
of
one
thing
only
am
i
certain
that
it
is
no
use
making
my
ideas
known
to
the
count
.
he
knows
well
that
i
am
imprisoned
and
as
he
has
done
it
himself
,
and
has
doubtless
his
own
motives
for
it
,
he
would
only
deceive
me
if
i
trusted
him
fully
with
the
facts
.
so
far
as
i
can
see
,
my
only
plan
will
be
to
keep
my
knowledge
and
my
fears
to
myself
,
and
my
eyes
open
.
i
am
,
i
know
,
either
being
deceived
,
like
a
baby
,
by
my
own
fears
,
or
else
i
am
in
desperate
straits
and
if
the
latter
be
so
,
i
need
,
and
shall
need
,
all
my
brains
to
get
through
.
i
had
hardly
come
to
this
conclusion
when
i
heard
the
great
door
below
shut
,
and
knew
that
the
count
had
returned
.
he
did
not
come
at
once
into
the
library
,
so
i
went
cautiously
to
my
own
room
and
found
him
making
the
bed
.
this
was
odd
,
but
only
confirmed
what
i
had
all
along
thought
that
there
were
no
servants
in
the
house
.
when
later
i
saw
him
through
the
chink
of
the
hinges
of
the
door
laying
the
table
in
the
dining
room
,
i
was
assured
of
it
for
if
he
does
himself
all
these
menial
offices
,
surely
it
is
proof
that
there
is
no
one
else
to
do
them
.
this
gave
me
a
fright
,
for
if
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
castle
,
it
must
have
been
the
count
himself
who
was
the
driver
of
the
coach
that
brought
me
here
.
this
is
a
terrible
thought
for
if
so
,
what
does
it
mean
that
he
could
control
the
wolves
,
as
he
did
,
by
only
holding
up
his
hand
in
silence
.
how
was
it
that
all
the
people
at
bistritz
and
on
the
coach
had
some
terrible
fear
for
me
?
what
meant
the
giving
of
the
crucifix
,
of
the
garlic
,
of
the
wild
rose
,
of
the
mountain
ash
?
bless
that
good
,
good
woman
who
hung
the
crucifix
round
my
neck
!
for
it
is
a
comfort
and
a
strength
to
me
whenever
i
touch
it
.
it
is
odd
that
a
thing
which
i
have
been
taught
to
regard
with
disfavour
and
as
idolatrous
should
in
a
time
of
loneliness
and
trouble
be
of
help
.
is
it
that
there
is
something
in
the
essence
of
the
thing
itself
,
or
that
it
is
a
medium
,
a
tangible
help
,
in
conveying
memories
of
sympathy
and
comfort
?
some
time
,
if
it
may
be
,
i
must
examine
this
matter
and
try
to
make
up
my
mind
about
it
.
in
the
meantime
i
must
find
out
all
i
can
about
count
dracula
,
as
it
may
help
me
to
understand
.
to
night
he
may
talk
of
himself
,
if
i
turn
the
conversation
that
way
.
i
must
be
very
careful
,
however
,
not
to
awake
his
suspicion
.
midnight
.
i
have
had
a
long
talk
with
the
count
.
i
asked
him
a
few
questions
on
transylvania
history
,
and
he
warmed
up
to
the
subject
wonderfully
.
in
his
speaking
of
things
and
people
,
and
especially
of
battles
,
he
spoke
as
if
he
had
been
present
at
them
all
.
this
he
afterwards
explained
by
saying
that
to
a
boyar
the
pride
of
his
house
and
name
is
his
own
pride
,
that
their
glory
is
his
glory
,
that
their
fate
is
his
fate
.
whenever
he
spoke
of
his
house
he
always
said
we
,
and
spoke
almost
in
the
plural
,
like
a
king
speaking
.
i
wish
i
could
put
down
all
he
said
exactly
as
he
said
it
,
for
to
me
it
was
most
fascinating
.
it
seemed
to
have
in
it
a
whole
history
of
the
country
.
he
grew
excited
as
he
spoke
,
and
walked
about
the
room
pulling
his
great
white
moustache
and
grasping
anything
on
which
he
laid
his
hands
as
though
he
would
crush
it
by
main
strength
.
one
thing
he
said
which
i
shall
put
down
as
nearly
as
i
can
for
it
tells
in
its
way
the
story
of
his
race
we
szekelys
have
a
right
to
be
proud
,
for
in
our
veins
flows
the
blood
of
many
brave
races
who
fought
as
the
lion
fights
,
for
lordship
.
here
,
in
the
whirlpool
of
european
races
,
the
ugric
tribe
bore
down
from
iceland
the
fighting
spirit
which
thor
and
wodin
gave
them
,
which
their
berserkers
displayed
to
such
fell
intent
on
the
seaboards
of
europe
,
ay
,
and
of
asia
and
africa
too
,
till
the
peoples
thought
that
the
were
wolves
themselves
had
come
.
here
,
too
,
when
they
came
,
they
found
the
huns
,
whose
warlike
fury
had
swept
the
earth
like
a
living
flame
,
till
the
dying
peoples
held
that
in
their
veins
ran
the
blood
of
those
old
witches
,
who
,
expelled
from
scythia
had
mated
with
the
devils
in
the
desert
.
fools
,
fools
!
what
devil
or
what
witch
was
ever
so
great
as
attila
,
whose
blood
is
in
these
veins
?
he
held
up
his
arms
.
is
it
a
wonder
that
we
were
a
conquering
race
that
we
were
proud
that
when
the
magyar
,
the
lombard
,
the
avar
,
the
bulgar
,
or
the
turk
poured
his
thousands
on
our
frontiers
,
we
drove
them
back
?
is
it
strange
that
when
arpad
and
his
legions
swept
through
the
hungarian
fatherland
he
found
us
here
when
he
reached
the
frontier
that
the
honfoglalas
was
completed
there
?
and
when
the
hungarian
flood
swept
eastward
,
the
szekelys
were
claimed
as
kindred
by
the
victorious
magyars
,
and
to
us
for
centuries
was
trusted
the
guarding
of
the
frontier
of
turkey
land
ay
,
and
more
than
that
,
endless
duty
of
the
frontier
guard
,
for
,
as
the
turks
say
,
water
sleeps
,
and
enemy
is
sleepless
.
who
more
gladly
than
we
throughout
the
four
nations
received
the
bloody
sword
,
or
at
its
warlike
call
flocked
quicker
to
the
standard
of
the
king
?
when
was
redeemed
that
great
shame
of
my
nation
,
the
shame
of
cassova
,
when
the
flags
of
the
wallach
and
the
magyar
went
down
beneath
the
crescent
?
who
was
it
but
one
of
my
own
race
who
as
voivode
crossed
the
danube
and
beat
the
turk
on
his
own
ground
?
this
was
a
dracula
indeed
!
woe
was
it
that
his
own
unworthy
brother
,
when
he
had
fallen
,
sold
his
people
to
the
turk
and
brought
the
shame
of
slavery
on
them
!
was
it
not
this
dracula
,
indeed
,
who
inspired
that
other
of
his
race
who
in
a
later
age
again
and
again
brought
his
forces
over
the
great
river
into
turkey
land
who
,
when
he
was
beaten
back
,
came
again
,
and
again
,
and
again
,
though
he
had
to
come
alone
from
the
bloody
field
where
his
troops
were
being
slaughtered
,
since
he
knew
that
he
alone
could
ultimately
triumph
!
they
said
that
he
thought
only
of
himself
.
bah
!
what
good
are
peasants
without
a
leader
?
where
ends
the
war
without
a
brain
and
heart
to
conduct
it
?
again
,
when
,
after
the
battle
of
moh
cs
,
we
threw
off
the
hungarian
yoke
,
we
of
the
dracula
blood
were
amongst
their
leaders
,
for
our
spirit
would
not
brook
that
we
were
not
free
.
ah
,
young
sir
,
the
szekelys
and
the
dracula
as
their
heart
s
blood
,
their
brains
,
and
their
swords
can
boast
a
record
that
mushroom
growths
like
the
hapsburgs
and
the
romanoffs
can
never
reach
.
the
warlike
days
are
over
.
blood
is
too
precious
a
thing
in
these
days
of
dishonourable
peace
and
the
glories
of
the
great
races
are
as
a
tale
that
is
told
.
it
was
by
this
time
close
on
morning
,
and
we
went
to
bed
.

.
,
this
diary
seems
horribly
like
the
beginning
of
the
arabian
nights
,
for
everything
has
to
break
off
at
cockcrow
or
like
the
ghost
of

12
may
.
let
me
begin
with
facts
bare
,
meagre
facts
,
verified
by
books
and
figures
,
and
of
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
.
i
must
not
confuse
them
with
experiences
which
will
have
to
rest
on
my
own
observation
,
or
my
memory
of
them
.
last
evening
when
the
count
came
from
his
room
he
began
by
asking
me
questions
on
legal
matters
and
on
the
doing
of
certain
kinds
of
business
.
i
had
spent
the
day
wearily
over
books
,
and
,
simply
to
keep
my
mind
occupied
,
went
over
some
of
the
matters
i
had
been
examining
at
lincoln
s
inn
.
there
was
a
certain
method
in
the
count
s
inquiries
,
so
i
shall
try
to
put
them
down
in
sequence
the
knowledge
may
somehow
or
some
time
be
useful
to
me
.
first
,
he
asked
if
a
man
in
england
might
have
two
solicitors
or
more
.
i
told
him
he
might
have
a
dozen
if
he
wished
,
but
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
have
more
than
one
solicitor
engaged
in
one
transaction
,
as
only
one
could
act
at
a
time
,
and
that
to
change
would
be
certain
to
militate
against
his
interest
.
he
seemed
thoroughly
to
understand
,
and
went
on
to
ask
if
there
would
be
any
practical
difficulty
in
having
one
man
to
attend
,
say
,
to
banking
,
and
another
to
look
after
shipping
,
in
case
local
help
were
needed
in
a
place
far
from
the
home
of
the
banking
solicitor
.
i
asked
him
to
explain
more
fully
,
so
that
i
might
not
by
any
chance
mislead
him
,
so
he
said
i
shall
illustrate
.
your
friend
and
mine
,
mr
.
peter
hawkins
,
from
under
the
shadow
of
your
beautiful
cathedral
at
exeter
,
which
is
far
from
london
,
buys
for
me
through
your
good
self
my
place
at
london
.
good
!
now
here
let
me
say
frankly
,
lest
you
should
think
it
strange
that
i
have
sought
the
services
of
one
so
far
off
from
london
instead
of
some
one
resident
there
,
that
my
motive
was
that
no
local
interest
might
be
served
save
my
wish
only
and
as
one
of
london
residence
might
,
perhaps
,
have
some
purpose
of
himself
or
friend
to
serve
,
i
went
thus
afield
to
seek
my
agent
,
whose
labours
should
be
only
to
my
interest
.
now
,
suppose
i
,
who
have
much
of
affairs
,
wish
to
ship
goods
,
say
,
to
newcastle
,
or
durham
,
or
harwich
,
or
dover
,
might
it
not
be
that
it
could
with
more
ease
be
done
by
consigning
to
one
in
these
ports
?
i
answered
that
certainly
it
would
be
most
easy
,
but
that
we
solicitors
had
a
system
of
agency
one
for
the
other
,
so
that
local
work
could
be
done
locally
on
instruction
from
any
solicitor
,
so
that
the
client
,
simply
placing
himself
in
the
hands
of
one
man
,
could
have
his
wishes
carried
out
by
him
without
further
trouble
.
but
,
said
he
,
i
could
be
at
liberty
to
direct
myself
.
is
it
not
so
?
of
course
,
i
replied
and
such
is
often
done
by
men
of
business
,
who
do
not
like
the
whole
of
their
affairs
to
be
known
by
any
one
person
.
good
!
he
said
,
and
then
went
on
to
ask
about
the
means
of
making
consignments
and
the
forms
to
be
gone
through
,
and
of
all
sorts
of
difficulties
which
might
arise
,
but
by
forethought
could
be
guarded
against
.
i
explained
all
these
things
to
him
to
the
best
of
my
ability
,
and
he
certainly
left
me
under
the
impression
that
he
would
have
made
a
wonderful
solicitor
,
for
there
was
nothing
that
he
did
not
think
of
or
foresee
.
for
a
man
who
was
never
in
the
country
,
and
who
did
not
evidently
do
much
in
the
way
of
business
,
his
knowledge
and
acumen
were
wonderful
.
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
on
these
points
of
which
he
had
spoken
,
and
i
had
verified
all
as
well
as
i
could
by
the
books
available
,
he
suddenly
stood
up
and
said
have
you
written
since
your
first
letter
to
our
friend
mr
.
peter
hawkins
,
or
to
any
other
?
it
was
with
some
bitterness
in
my
heart
that
i
answered
that
i
had
not
,
that
as
yet
i
had
not
seen
any
opportunity
of
sending
letters
to
anybody
.
then
write
now
,
my
young
friend
,
he
said
,
laying
a
heavy
hand
on
my
shoulder
write
to
our
friend
and
to
any
other
and
say
,
if
it
will
please
you
,
that
you
shall
stay
with
me
until
a
month
from
now
.
do
you
wish
me
to
stay
so
long
?
i
asked
,
for
my
heart
grew
cold
at
the
thought
.
i
desire
it
much
nay
,
i
will
take
no
refusal
.
when
your
master
,
employer
,
what
you
will
,
engaged
that
someone
should
come
on
his
behalf
,
it
was
understood
that
my
needs
only
were
to
be
consulted
.
i
have
not
stinted
.
is
it
not
so
?
what
could
i
do
but
bow
acceptance
?
it
was
mr
.
hawkins
s
interest
,
not
mine
,
and
i
had
to
think
of
him
,
not
myself
and
besides
,
while
count
dracula
was
speaking
,
there
was
that
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
bearing
which
made
me
remember
that
i
was
a
prisoner
,
and
that
if
i
wished
it
i
could
have
no
choice
.
the
count
saw
his
victory
in
my
bow
,
and
his
mastery
in
the
trouble
of
my
face
,
for
he
began
at
once
to
use
them
,
but
in
his
own
smooth
,
resistless
way
i
pray
you
,
my
good
young
friend
,
that
you
will
not
discourse
of
things
other
than
business
in
your
letters
.
it
will
doubtless
please
your
friends
to
know
that
you
are
well
,
and
that
you
look
forward
to
getting
home
to
them
.
is
it
not
so
?
as
he
spoke
he
handed
me
three
sheets
of
note
paper
and
three
envelopes
.
they
were
all
of
the
thinnest
foreign
post
,
and
looking
at
them
,
then
at
him
,
and
noticing
his
quiet
smile
,
with
the
sharp
,
canine
teeth
lying
over
the
red
underlip
,
i
understood
as
well
as
if
he
had
spoken
that
i
should
be
careful
what
i
wrote
,
for
he
would
be
able
to
read
it
.
so
i
determined
to
write
only
formal
notes
now
,
but
to
write
fully
to
mr
.
hawkins
in
secret
,
and
also
to
mina
,
for
to
her
i
could
write
in
shorthand
,
which
would
puzzle
the
count
,
if
he
did
see
it
.
when
i
had
written
my
two
letters
i
sat
quiet
,
reading
a
book
whilst
the
count
wrote
several
notes
,
referring
as
he
wrote
them
to
some
books
on
his
table
.
then
he
took
up
my
two
and
placed
them
with
his
own
,
and
put
by
his
writing
materials
,
after
which
,
the
instant
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
,
i
leaned
over
and
looked
at
the
letters
,
which
were
face
down
on
the
table
.
i
felt
no
compunction
in
doing
so
,
for
under
the
circumstances
i
felt
that
i
should
protect
myself
in
every
way
i
could
.
one
of
the
letters
was
directed
to
samuel
f
.
billington
,
no

,
and
the

to

,

,
buda

.
the
second
and
fourth
were
unsealed
.
i
was
just
about
to
look
at
them
when
i
saw
the
door
handle
move
.
i
sank
back
in
my
seat
,
having
just
had
time
to
replace
the
letters
as
they
had
been
and
to
resume
my
book
before
the
count
,
holding
still
another
letter
in
his
hand
,
entered
the
room
.
he
took
up
the
letters
on
the
table
and
stamped
them
carefully
,
and
then
turning
to
me
,
said
i
trust
you
will
forgive
me
,
but
i
have
much
work
to
do
in
private
this
evening
.
you
will
,
i
hope
,
find
all
things
as
you
wish
.
at
the
door
he
turned
,
and
after
a
moment
s
pause
said
let
me
advise
you
,
my
dear
young
friend
nay
,
let
me
warn
you
with
all
seriousness
,
that
should
you
leave
these
rooms
you
will
not
by
any
chance
go
to
sleep
in
any
other
part
of
the
castle
.
it
is
old
,
and
has
many
memories
,
and
there
are
bad
dreams
for
those
who
sleep
unwisely
.
be
warned
!
should
sleep
now
or
ever
overcome
you
,
or
be
like
to
do
,
then
haste
to
your
own
chamber
or
to
these
rooms
,
for
your
rest
will
then
be
safe
.
but
if
you
be
not
careful
in
this
respect
,
then
he
finished
his
speech
in
a
gruesome
way
,
for
he
motioned
with
his
hands
as
if
he
were
washing
them
.
i
quite
understood
my
only
doubt
was
as
to
whether
any
dream
could
be
more
terrible
than
the
unnatural
,
horrible
net
of
gloom
and
mystery
which
seemed
closing
around
me
.
later
.
i
endorse
the
last
words
written
,
but
this
time
there
is
no
doubt
in
question
.
i
shall
not
fear
to
sleep
in
any
place
where
he
is
not
.
i
have
placed
the
crucifix
over
the
head
of
my
bed
i
imagine
that
my
rest
is
thus
freer
from
dreams
and
there
it
shall
remain
.
when
he
left
me
i
went
to
my
room
.
after
a
little
while
,
not
hearing
any
sound
,
i
came
out
and
went
up
the
stone
stair
to
where
i
could
look
out
towards
the
south
.
there
was
some
sense
of
freedom
in
the
vast
expanse
,
inaccessible
though
it
was
to
me
,
as
compared
with
the
narrow
darkness
of
the
courtyard
.
looking
out
on
this
,
i
felt
that
i
was
indeed
in
prison
,
and
i
seemed
to
want
a
breath
of
fresh
air
,
though
it
were
of
the
night
.
i
am
beginning
to
feel
this
nocturnal
existence
tell
on
me
.
it
is
destroying
my
nerve
.
i
start
at
my
own
shadow
,
and
am
full
of
all
sorts
of
horrible
imaginings
.
god
knows
that
there
is
ground
for
my
terrible
fear
in
this
accursed
place
!
i
looked
out
over
the
beautiful
expanse
,
bathed
in
soft
yellow
moonlight
till
it
was
almost
as
light
as
day
.
in
the
soft
light
the
distant
hills
became
melted
,
and
the
shadows
in
the
valleys
and
gorges
of
velvety
blackness
.
the
mere
beauty
seemed
to
cheer
me
there
was
peace
and
comfort
in
every
breath
i
drew
.
as
i
leaned
from
the
window
my
eye
was
caught
by
something
moving
a
storey
below
me
,
and
somewhat
to
my
left
,
where
i
imagined
,
from
the
order
of
the
rooms
,
that
the
windows
of
the
count
s
own
room
would
look
out
.
the
window
at
which
i
stood
was
tall
and
deep
,
stone
mullioned
,
and
though
weatherworn
,
was
still
complete
but
it
was
evidently
many
a
day
since
the
case
had
been
there
.
i
drew
back
behind
the
stonework
,
and
looked
carefully
out
.
what
i
saw
was
the
count
s
head
coming
out
from
the
window
.
i
did
not
see
the
face
,
but
i
knew
the
man
by
the
neck
and
the
movement
of
his
back
and
arms
.
in
any
case
i
could
not
mistake
the
hands
which
i
had
had
so
many
opportunities
of
studying
.
i
was
at
first
interested
and
somewhat
amused
,
for
it
is
wonderful
how
small
a
matter
will
interest
and
amuse
a
man
when
he
is
a
prisoner
.
but
my
very
feelings
changed
to
repulsion
and
terror
when
i
saw
the
whole
man
slowly
emerge
from
the
window
and
begin
to
crawl
down
the
castle
wall
over
that
dreadful
abyss
,
face
down
with
his
cloak
spreading
out
around
him
like
great
wings
.
at
first
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
.
i
thought
it
was
some
trick
of
the
moonlight
,
some
weird
effect
of
shadow
but
i
kept
looking
,
and
it
could
be
no
delusion
.
i
saw
the
fingers
and
toes
grasp
the
corners
of
the
stones
,
worn
clear
of
the
mortar
by
the
stress
of
years
,
and
by
thus
using
every
projection
and
inequality
move
downwards
with
considerable
speed
,
just
as
a
lizard
moves
along
a
wall
.
what
manner
of
man
is
this
,
or
what
manner
of
creature
is
it
in
the
semblance
of
man
?
i
feel
the
dread
of
this
horrible
place
overpowering
me
i
am
in
fear
in
awful
fear
and
there
is
no
escape
for
me
i
am
encompassed
about
with
terrors
that
i
dare
not
think
of
....
15
may
.
once
more
have
i
seen
the
count
go
out
in
his
lizard
fashion
.
he
moved
downwards
in
a
sidelong
way
,
some
hundred
feet
down
,
and
a
good
deal
to
the
left
.
he
vanished
into
some
hole
or
window
.
when
his
head
had
disappeared
,
i
leaned
out
to
try
and
see
more
,
but
without
avail
the
distance
was
too
great
to
allow
a
proper
angle
of
sight
.
i
knew
he
had
left
the
castle
now
,
and
thought
to
use
the
opportunity
to
explore
more
than
i
had
dared
to
do
as
yet
.
i
went
back
to
the
room
,
and
taking
a
lamp
,
tried
all
the
doors
.
they
were
all
locked
,
as
i
had
expected
,
and
the
locks
were
comparatively
new
but
i
went
down
the
stone
stairs
to
the
hall
where
i
had
entered
originally
.
i
found
i
could
pull
back
the
bolts
easily
enough
and
unhook
the
great
chains
but
the
door
was
locked
,
and
the
key
was
gone
!
that
key
must
be
in
the
count
s
room
i
must
watch
should
his
door
be
unlocked
,
so
that
i
may
get
it
and
escape
.
i
went
on
to
make
a
thorough
examination
of
the
various
stairs
and
passages
,
and
to
try
the
doors
that
opened
from
them
.
one
or
two
small
rooms
near
the
hall
were
open
,
but
there
was
nothing
to
see
in
them
except
old
furniture
,
dusty
with
age
and
moth
eaten
.
at
last
,
however
,
i
found
one
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairway
which
,
though
it
seemed
to
be
locked
,
gave
a
little
under
pressure
.
i
tried
it
harder
,
and
found
that
it
was
not
really
locked
,
but
that
the
resistance
came
from
the
fact
that
the
hinges
had
fallen
somewhat
,
and
the
heavy
door
rested
on
the
floor
.
here
was
an
opportunity
which
i
might
not
have
again
,
so
i
exerted
myself
,
and
with
many
efforts
forced
it
back
so
that
i
could
enter
.
i
was
now
in
a
wing
of
the
castle
further
to
the
right
than
the
rooms
i
knew
and
a
storey
lower
down
.
from
the
windows
i
could
see
that
the
suite
of
rooms
lay
along
to
the
south
of
the
castle
,
the
windows
of
the
end
room
looking
out
both
west
and
south
.
on
the
latter
side
,
as
well
as
to
the
former
,
there
was
a
great
precipice
.
the
castle
was
built
on
the
corner
of
a
great
rock
,
so
that
on
three
sides
it
was
quite
impregnable
,
and
great
windows
were
placed
here
where
sling
,
or
bow
,
or
culverin
could
not
reach
,
and
consequently
light
and
comfort
,
impossible
to
a
position
which
had
to
be
guarded
,
were
secured
.
to
the
west
was
a
great
valley
,
and
then
,
rising
far
away
,
great
jagged
mountain
fastnesses
,
rising
peak
on
peak
,
the
sheer
rock
studded
with
mountain
ash
and
thorn
,
whose
roots
clung
in
cracks
and
crevices
and
crannies
of
the
stone
.
this
was
evidently
the
portion
of
the
castle
occupied
by
the
ladies
in
bygone
days
,
for
the
furniture
had
more
air
of
comfort
than
any
i
had
seen
.
the
windows
were
curtainless
,
and
the
yellow
moonlight
,
flooding
in
through
the
diamond
panes
,
enabled
one
to
see
even
colours
,
whilst
it
softened
the
wealth
of
dust
which
lay
over
all
and
disguised
in
some
measure
the
ravages
of
time
and
the
moth
.
my
lamp
seemed
to
be
of
little
effect
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
,
but
i
was
glad
to
have
it
with
me
,
for
there
was
a
dread
loneliness
in
the
place
which
chilled
my
heart
and
made
my
nerves
tremble
.
still
,
it
was
better
than
living
alone
in
the
rooms
which
i
had
come
to
hate
from
the
presence
of
the
count
,
and
after
trying
a
little
to
school
my
nerves
,
i
found
a
soft
quietude
come
over
me
.
here
i
am
,
sitting
at
a
little
oak
table
where
in
old
times
possibly
some
fair
lady
sat
to
pen
,
with
much
thought
and
many
blushes
,
her
ill
spelt
love
letter
,
and
writing
in
my
diary
in
shorthand
all
that
has
happened
since
i
closed
it
last
.
it
is
nineteenth
century
up
to
date
with
a
vengeance
.
and
yet
,
unless
my
senses
deceive
me
,
the
old
centuries
had
,
and
have
,
powers
of
their
own
which
mere
modernity
cannot
kill
.
later

morning
of

may
.
god
preserve
my
sanity
,
for
to
this
i
am
reduced
.
safety
and
the
assurance
of
safety
are
things
of
the
past
.
whilst
i
live
on
here
there
is
but
one
thing
to
hope
for
,
that
i
may
not
go
mad
,
if
,
indeed
,
i
be
not
mad
already
.
if
i
be
sane
,
then
surely
it
is
maddening
to
think
that
of
all
the
foul
things
that
lurk
in
this
hateful
place
the
count
is
the
least
dreadful
to
me
that
to
him
alone
i
can
look
for
safety
,
even
though
this
be
only
whilst
i
can
serve
his
purpose
.
great
god
!
merciful
god
!
let
me
be
calm
,
for
out
of
that
way
lies
madness
indeed
.
i
begin
to
get
new
lights
on
certain
things
which
have
puzzled
me
.
up
to
now
i
never
quite
knew
what
shakespeare
meant
when
he
made
hamlet
say
my
tablets
!
quick
,
my
tablets
!
tis
meet
that
i
put
it
down
,
etc
.,
for
now
,
feeling
as
though
my
own
brain
were
unhinged
or
as
if
the
shock
had
come
which
must
end
in
its
undoing
,
i
turn
to
my
diary
for
repose
.
the
habit
of
entering
accurately
must
help
to
soothe
me
.
the
count
s
mysterious
warning
frightened
me
at
the
time
it
frightens
me
more
now
when
i
think
of
it
,
for
in
future
he
has
a
fearful
hold
upon
me
.
i
shall
fear
to
doubt
what
he
may
say
!
when
i
had
written
in
my
diary
and
had
fortunately
replaced
the
book
and
pen
in
my
pocket
i
felt
sleepy
.
the
count
s
warning
came
into
my
mind
,
but
i
took
a
pleasure
in
disobeying
it
.
the
sense
of
sleep
was
upon
me
,
and
with
it
the
obstinacy
which
sleep
brings
as
outrider
.
the
soft
moonlight
soothed
,
and
the
wide
expanse
without
gave
a
sense
of
freedom
which
refreshed
me
.
i
determined
not
to
return
to
night
to
the
gloom
haunted
rooms
,
but
to
sleep
here
,
where
,
of
old
,
ladies
had
sat
and
sung
and
lived
sweet
lives
whilst
their
gentle
breasts
were
sad
for
their
menfolk
away
in
the
midst
of
remorseless
wars
.
i
drew
a
great
couch
out
of
its
place
near
the
corner
,
so
that
as
i
lay
,
i
could
look
at
the
lovely
view
to
east
and
south
,
and
unthinking
of
and
uncaring
for
the
dust
,
composed
myself
for
sleep
.
i
suppose
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
i
hope
so
,
but
i
fear
,
for
all
that
followed
was
startlingly
real
so
real
that
now
sitting
here
in
the
broad
,
full
sunlight
of
the
morning
,
i
cannot
in
the
least
believe
that
it
was
all
sleep
.
i
was
not
alone
.
the
room
was
the
same
,
unchanged
in
any
way
since
i
came
into
it
i
could
see
along
the
floor
,
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
,
my
own
footsteps
marked
where
i
had
disturbed
the
long
accumulation
of
dust
.
in
the
moonlight
opposite
me
were
three
young
women
,
ladies
by
their
dress
and
manner
.
i
thought
at
the
time
that
i
must
be
dreaming
when
i
saw
them
,
for
,
though
the
moonlight
was
behind
them
,
they
threw
no
shadow
on
the
floor
.
they
came
close
to
me
,
and
looked
at
me
for
some
time
,
and
then
whispered
together
.
two
were
dark
,
and
had
high
aquiline
noses
,
like
the
count
,
and
great
dark
,
piercing
eyes
that
seemed
to
be
almost
red
when
contrasted
with
the
pale
yellow
moon
.
the
other
was
fair
,
as
fair
as
can
be
,
with
great
wavy
masses
of
golden
hair
and
eyes
like
pale
sapphires
.
i
seemed
somehow
to
know
her
face
,
and
to
know
it
in
connection
with
some
dreamy
fear
,
but
i
could
not
recollect
at
the
moment
how
or
where
.
all
three
had
brilliant
white
teeth
that
shone
like
pearls
against
the
ruby
of
their
voluptuous
lips
.
there
was
something
about
them
that
made
me
uneasy
,
some
longing
and
at
the
same
time
some
deadly
fear
.
i
felt
in
my
heart
a
wicked
,
burning
desire
that
they
would
kiss
me
with
those
red
lips
.
it
is
not
good
to
note
this
down
,
lest
some
day
it
should
meet
mina
s
eyes
and
cause
her
pain
but
it
is
the
truth
.
they
whispered
together
,
and
then
they
all
three
laughed
such
a
silvery
,
musical
laugh
,
but
as
hard
as
though
the
sound
never
could
have
come
through
the
softness
of
human
lips
.
it
was
like
the
intolerable
,
tingling
sweetness
of
water
glasses
when
played
on
by
a
cunning
hand
.
the
fair
girl
shook
her
head
coquettishly
,
and
the
other
two
urged
her
on
.
one
said
go
on
!
you
are
first
,
and
we
shall
follow
yours
is
the
right
to
begin
.
the
other
added
he
is
young
and
strong
there
are
kisses
for
us
all
.
i
lay
quiet
,
looking
out
under
my
eyelashes
in
an
agony
of
delightful
anticipation
.
the
fair
girl
advanced
and
bent
over
me
till
i
could
feel
the
movement
of
her
breath
upon
me
.
sweet
it
was
in
one
sense
,
honey
sweet
,
and
sent
the
same
tingling
through
the
nerves
as
her
voice
,
but
with
a
bitter
underlying
the
sweet
,
a
bitter
offensiveness
,
as
one
smells
in
blood
.
i
was
afraid
to
raise
my
eyelids
,
but
looked
out
and
saw
perfectly
under
the
lashes
.
the
girl
went
on
her
knees
,
and
bent
over
me
,
simply
gloating
.
there
was
a
deliberate
voluptuousness
which
was
both
thrilling
and
repulsive
,
and
as
she
arched
her
neck
she
actually
licked
her
lips
like
an
animal
,
till
i
could
see
in
the
moonlight
the
moisture
shining
on
the
scarlet
lips
and
on
the
red
tongue
as
it
lapped
the
white
sharp
teeth
.
lower
and
lower
went
her
head
as
the
lips
went
below
the
range
of
my
mouth
and
chin
and
seemed
about
to
fasten
on
my
throat
.
then
she
paused
,
and
i
could
hear
the
churning
sound
of
her
tongue
as
it
licked
her
teeth
and
lips
,
and
could
feel
the
hot
breath
on
my
neck
.
then
the
skin
of
my
throat
began
to
tingle
as
one
s
flesh
does
when
the
hand
that
is
to
tickle
it
approaches
nearer
nearer
.
i
could
feel
the
soft
,
shivering
touch
of
the
lips
on
the
super
sensitive
skin
of
my
throat
,
and
the
hard
dents
of
two
sharp
teeth
,
just
touching
and
pausing
there
.
i
closed
my
eyes
in
a
languorous
ecstasy
and
waited
waited
with
beating
heart
.
but
at
that
instant
,
another
sensation
swept
through
me
as
quick
as
lightning
.
i
was
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
count
,
and
of
his
being
as
if
lapped
in
a
storm
of
fury
.
as
my
eyes
opened
involuntarily
i
saw
his
strong
hand
grasp
the
slender
neck
of
the
fair
woman
and
with
giant
s
power
draw
it
back
,
the
blue
eyes
transformed
with
fury
,
the
white
teeth
champing
with
rage
,
and
the
fair
cheeks
blazing
red
with
passion
.
but
the
count
!
never
did
i
imagine
such
wrath
and
fury
,
even
to
the
demons
of
the
pit
.
his
eyes
were
positively
blazing
.
the
red
light
in
them
was
lurid
,
as
if
the
flames
of
hell
fire
blazed
behind
them
.
his
face
was
deathly
pale
,
and
the
lines
of
it
were
hard
like
drawn
wires
the
thick
eyebrows
that
met
over
the
nose
now
seemed
like
a
heaving
bar
of
white
hot
metal
.
with
a
fierce
sweep
of
his
arm
,
he
hurled
the
woman
from
him
,
and
then
motioned
to
the
others
,
as
though
he
were
beating
them
back
it
was
the
same
imperious
gesture
that
i
had
seen
used
to
the
wolves
.
in
a
voice
which
,
though
low
and
almost
in
a
whisper
seemed
to
cut
through
the
air
and
then
ring
round
the
room
he
said
how
dare
you
touch
him
,
any
of
you
?
how
dare
you
cast
eyes
on
him
when
i
had
forbidden
it
?
back
,
i
tell
you
all
!
this
man
belongs
to
me
!
beware
how
you
meddle
with
him
,
or
you
ll
have
to
deal
with
me
.
the
fair
girl
,
with
a
laugh
of
ribald
coquetry
,
turned
to
answer
him
you
yourself
never
loved
you
never
love
!
on
this
the
other
women
joined
,
and
such
a
mirthless
,
hard
,
soulless
laughter
rang
through
the
room
that
it
almost
made
me
faint
to
hear
it
seemed
like
the
pleasure
of
fiends
.
then
the
count
turned
,
after
looking
at
my
face
attentively
,
and
said
in
a
soft
whisper
yes
,
i
too
can
love
you
yourselves
can
tell
it
from
the
past
.
is
it
not
so
?
well
,
now
i
promise
you
that
when
i
am
done
with
him
you
shall
kiss
him
at
your
will
.
now
go
!
go
!
i
must
awaken
him
,
for
there
is
work
to
be
done
.
are
we
to
have
nothing
to
night
?
said
one
of
them
,
with
a
low
laugh
,
as
she
pointed
to
the
bag
which
he
had
thrown
upon
the
floor
,
and
which
moved
as
though
there
were
some
living
thing
within
it
.
for
answer
he
nodded
his
head
.
one
of
the
women
jumped
forward
and
opened
it
.
if
my
ears
did
not
deceive
me
there
was
a
gasp
and
a
low
wail
,
as
of
a
half
smothered
child
.
the
women
closed
round
,
whilst
i
was
aghast
with
horror
but
as
i
looked
they
disappeared
,
and
with
them
the
dreadful
bag
.
there
was
no
door
near
them
,
and
they
could
not
have
passed
me
without
my
noticing
.
they
simply
seemed
to
fade
into
the
rays
of
the
moonlight
and
pass
out
through
the
window
,
for
i
could
see
outside
the
dim
,
shadowy
forms
for
a
moment
before
they
entirely
faded
away
.
then
the
horror
overcame
me
,
and
i
sank
down
unconscious
.
chapter
iv
jonathan
harker
s
journal
continued
i
awoke
in
my
own
bed
.
if
it
be
that
i
had
not
dreamt
,
the
count
must
have
carried
me
here
.
i
tried
to
satisfy
myself
on
the
subject
,
but
could
not
arrive
at
any
unquestionable
result
.
to
be
sure
,
there
were
certain
small
evidences
,
such
as
that
my
clothes
were
folded
and
laid
by
in
a
manner
which
was
not
my
habit
.
my
watch
was
still
unwound
,
and
i
am
rigorously
accustomed
to
wind
it
the
last
thing
before
going
to
bed
,
and
many
such
details
.
but
these
things
are
no
proof
,
for
they
may
have
been
evidences
that
my
mind
was
not
as
usual
,
and
,
from
some
cause
or
another
,
i
had
certainly
been
much
upset
.
i
must
watch
for
proof
.
of
one
thing
i
am
glad
if
it
was
that
the
count
carried
me
here
and
undressed
me
,
he
must
have
been
hurried
in
his
task
,
for
my
pockets
are
intact
.
i
am
sure
this
diary
would
have
been
a
mystery
to
him
which
he
would
not
have
brooked
.
he
would
have
taken
or
destroyed
it
.
as
i
look
round
this
room
,
although
it
has
been
to
me
so
full
of
fear
,
it
is
now
a
sort
of
sanctuary
,
for
nothing
can
be
more
dreadful
than
those
awful
women
,
who
were
who
are
waiting
to
suck
my
blood
.
18
may
.
i
have
been
down
to
look
at
that
room
again
in
daylight
,
for
i
must
know
the
truth
.
when
i
got
to
the
doorway
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
found
it
closed
.
it
had
been
so
forcibly
driven
against
the
jamb
that
part
of
the
woodwork
was
splintered
.
i
could
see
that
the
bolt
of
the
lock
had
not
been
shot
,
but
the
door
is
fastened
from
the
inside
.
i
fear
it
was
no
dream
,
and
must
act
on
this
surmise
.
19
may
.
i
am
surely
in
the
toils
.
last
night
the
count
asked
me
in
the
suavest
tones
to
write
three
letters
,
one
saying
that
my
work
here
was
nearly
done
,
and
that
i
should
start
for
home
within
a
few
days
,
another
that
i
was
starting
on
the
next
morning
from
the
time
of
the
letter
,
and
the
third
that
i
had
left
the
castle
and
arrived
at
bistritz
.
i
would
fain
have
rebelled
,
but
felt
that
in
the
present
state
of
things
it
would
be
madness
to
quarrel
openly
with
the
count
whilst
i
am
so
absolutely
in
his
power
and
to
refuse
would
be
to
excite
his
suspicion
and
to
arouse
his
anger
.
he
knows
that
i
know
too
much
,
and
that
i
must
not
live
,
lest
i
be
dangerous
to
him
my
only
chance
is
to
prolong
my
opportunities
.
something
may
occur
which
will
give
me
a
chance
to
escape
.
i
saw
in
his
eyes
something
of
that
gathering
wrath
which
was
manifest
when
he
hurled
that
fair
woman
from
him
.
he
explained
to
me
that
posts
were
few
and
uncertain
,
and
that
my
writing
now
would
ensure
ease
of
mind
to
my
friends
and
he
assured
me
with
so
much
impressiveness
that
he
would
countermand
the
later
letters
,
which
would
be
held
over
at
bistritz
until
due
time
in
case
chance
would
admit
of
my
prolonging
my
stay
,
that
to
oppose
him
would
have
been
to
create
new
suspicion
.
i
therefore
pretended
to
fall
in
with
his
views
,
and
asked
him
what
dates
i
should
put
on
the
letters
.
he
calculated
a
minute
,
and
then
said
the
first
should
be
june
12
,
the
second
june
19
,
and
the
third
june
29
.
i
know
now
the
span
of
my
life
.
god
help
me
!
28
may
.
there
is
a
chance
of
escape
,
or
at
any
rate
of
being
able
to
send
word
home
.
a
band
of
szgany
have
come
to
the
castle
,
and
are
encamped
in
the
courtyard
.
these
szgany
are
gipsies
i
have
notes
of
them
in
my
book
.
they
are
peculiar
to
this
part
of
the
world
,
though
allied
to
the
ordinary
gipsies
all
the
world
over
.
there
are
thousands
of
them
in
hungary
and
transylvania
,
who
are
almost
outside
all
law
.
they
attach
themselves
as
a
rule
to
some
great
noble
or
boyar
,
and
call
themselves
by
his
name
.
they
are
fearless
and
without
religion
,
save
superstition
,
and
they
talk
only
their
own
varieties
of
the
romany
tongue
.
i
shall
write
some
letters
home
,
and
shall
try
to
get
them
to
have
them
posted
.
i
have
already
spoken
them
through
my
window
to
begin
acquaintanceship
.
they
took
their
hats
off
and
made
obeisance
and
many
signs
,
which
,
however
,
i
could
not
understand
any
more
than
i
could
their
spoken
language
....
i
have
written
the
letters
.
mina
s
is
in
shorthand
,
and
i
simply
ask
mr
.
hawkins
to
communicate
with
her
.
to
her
i
have
explained
my
situation
,
but
without
the
horrors
which
i
may
only
surmise
.
it
would
shock
and
frighten
her
to
death
were
i
to
expose
my
heart
to
her
.
should
the
letters
not
carry
,
then
the
count
shall
not
yet
know
my
secret
or
the
extent
of
my
knowledge
....
i
have
given
the
letters
i
threw
them
through
the
bars
of
my
window
with
a
gold
piece
,
and
made
what
signs
i
could
to
have
them
posted
.
the
man
who
took
them
pressed
them
to
his
heart
and
bowed
,
and
then
put
them
in
his
cap
.
i
could
do
no
more
.
i
stole
back
to
the
study
,
and
began
to
read
.
as
the
count
did
not
come
in
,
i
have
written
here
....
the
count
has
come
.
he
sat
down
beside
me
,
and
said
in
his
smoothest
voice
as
he
opened
two
letters
the
szgany
has
given
me
these
,
of
which
,
though
i
know
not
whence
they
come
,
i
shall
,
of
course
,
take
care
.
see
!
he
must
have
looked
at
it
one
is
from
you
,
and
to
my
friend
peter
hawkins
the
other
here
he
caught
sight
of
the
strange
symbols
as
he
opened
the
envelope
,
and
the
dark
look
came
into
his
face
,
and
his
eyes
blazed
wickedly
the
other
is
a
vile
thing
,
an
outrage
upon
friendship
and
hospitality
!
it
is
not
signed
.
well
!
so
it
cannot
matter
to
us
.
and
he
calmly
held
letter
and
envelope
in
the
flame
of
the
lamp
till
they
were
consumed
.
then
he
went
on
the
letter
to
hawkins
that
i
shall
,
of
course
,
send
on
,
since
it
is
yours
.
your
letters
are
sacred
to
me
.
your
pardon
,
my
friend
,
that
unknowingly
i
did
break
the
seal
.
will
you
not
cover
it
again
?
he
held
out
the
letter
to
me
,
and
with
a
courteous
bow
handed
me
a
clean
envelope
.
i
could
only
redirect
it
and
hand
it
to
him
in
silence
.
when
he
went
out
of
the
room
i
could
hear
the
key
turn
softly
.
a
minute
later
i
went
over
and
tried
it
,
and
the
door
was
locked
.
when
,
an
hour
or
two
after
,
the
count
came
quietly
into
the
room
,
his
coming
awakened
me
,
for
i
had
gone
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
.
he
was
very
courteous
and
very
cheery
in
his
manner
,
and
seeing
that
i
had
been
sleeping
,
he
said
so
,
my
friend
,
you
are
tired
?
get
to
bed
.
there
is
the
surest
rest
.
i
may
not
have
the
pleasure
to
talk
to
night
,
since
there
are
many
labours
to
me
but
you
will
sleep
,
i
pray
.
i
passed
to
my
room
and
went
to
bed
,
and
,
strange
to
say
,
slept
without
dreaming
.
despair
has
its
own
calms
.
31
may
.
this
morning
when
i
woke
i
thought
i
would
provide
myself
with
some
paper
and
envelopes
from
my
bag
and
keep
them
in
my
pocket
,
so
that
i
might
write
in
case
i
should
get
an
opportunity
,
but
again
a
surprise
,
again
a
shock
!
every
scrap
of
paper
was
gone
,
and
with
it
all
my
notes
,
my
memoranda
,
relating
to
railways
and
travel
,
my
letter
of
credit
,
in
fact
all
that
might
be
useful
to
me
were
i
once
outside
the
castle
.
i
sat
and
pondered
awhile
,
and
then
some
thought
occurred
to
me
,
and
i
made
search
of
my
portmanteau
and
in
the
wardrobe
where
i
had
placed
my
clothes
.
the
suit
in
which
i
had
travelled
was
gone
,
and
also
my
overcoat
and
rug
i
could
find
no
trace
of
them
anywhere
.
this
looked
like
some
new
scheme
of
villainy
....
17
june
.
this
morning
,
as
i
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
cudgelling
my
brains
,
i
heard
without
a
cracking
of
whips
and
pounding
and
scraping
of
horses
feet
up
the
rocky
path
beyond
the
courtyard
.
with
joy
i
hurried
to
the
window
,
and
saw
drive
into
the
yard
two
great
leiter
wagons
,
each
drawn
by
eight
sturdy
horses
,
and
at
the
head
of
each
pair
a
slovak
,
with
his
wide
hat
,
great
nail
studded
belt
,
dirty
sheepskin
,
and
high
boots
.
they
had
also
their
long
staves
in
hand
.
i
ran
to
the
door
,
intending
to
descend
and
try
and
join
them
through
the
main
hall
,
as
i
thought
that
way
might
be
opened
for
them
.
again
a
shock
my
door
was
fastened
on
the
outside
.
then
i
ran
to
the
window
and
cried
to
them
.
they
looked
up
at
me
stupidly
and
pointed
,
but
just
then
the
hetman
of
the
szgany
came
out
,
and
seeing
them
pointing
to
my
window
,
said
something
,
at
which
they
laughed
.
henceforth
no
effort
of
mine
,
no
piteous
cry
or
agonised
entreaty
,
would
make
them
even
look
at
me
.
they
resolutely
turned
away
.
the
leiter
wagons
contained
great
,
square
boxes
,
with
handles
of
thick
rope
these
were
evidently
empty
by
the
ease
with
which
the
slovaks
handled
them
,
and
by
their
resonance
as
they
were
roughly
moved
.
when
they
were
all
unloaded
and
packed
in
a
great
heap
in
one
corner
of
the
yard
,
the
slovaks
were
given
some
money
by
the
szgany
,
and
spitting
on
it
for
luck
,
lazily
went
each
to
his
horse
s
head
.
shortly
afterwards
,
i
heard
the
cracking
of
their
whips
die
away
in
the
distance
.
24
june
,
before
morning
.
last
night
the
count
left
me
early
,
and
locked
himself
into
his
own
room
.
as
soon
as
i
dared
i
ran
up
the
winding
stair
,
and
looked
out
of
the
window
,
which
opened
south
.
i
thought
i
would
watch
for
the
count
,
for
there
is
something
going
on
.
the
szgany
are
quartered
somewhere
in
the
castle
and
are
doing
work
of
some
kind
.
i
know
it
,
for
now
and
then
i
hear
a
far
away
muffled
sound
as
of
mattock
and
spade
,
and
,
whatever
it
is
,
it
must
be
the
end
of
some
ruthless
villainy
.
i
had
been
at
the
window
somewhat
less
than
half
an
hour
,
when
i
saw
something
coming
out
of
the
count
s
window
.
i
drew
back
and
watched
carefully
,
and
saw
the
whole
man
emerge
.
it
was
a
new
shock
to
me
to
find
that
he
had
on
the
suit
of
clothes
which
i
had
worn
whilst
travelling
here
,
and
slung
over
his
shoulder
the
terrible
bag
which
i
had
seen
the
women
take
away
.
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
his
quest
,
and
in
my
garb
,
too
!
this
,
then
,
is
his
new
scheme
of
evil
that
he
will
allow
others
to
see
me
,
as
they
think
,
so
that
he
may
both
leave
evidence
that
i
have
been
seen
in
the
towns
or
villages
posting
my
own
letters
,
and
that
any
wickedness
which
he
may
do
shall
by
the
local
people
be
attributed
to
me
.
it
makes
me
rage
to
think
that
this
can
go
on
,
and
whilst
i
am
shut
up
here
,
a
veritable
prisoner
,
but
without
that
protection
of
the
law
which
is
even
a
criminal
s
right
and
consolation
.
i
thought
i
would
watch
for
the
count
s
return
,
and
for
a
long
time
sat
doggedly
at
the
window
.
then
i
began
to
notice
that
there
were
some
quaint
little
specks
floating
in
the
rays
of
the
moonlight
.
they
were
like
the
tiniest
grains
of
dust
,
and
they
whirled
round
and
gathered
in
clusters
in
a
nebulous
sort
of
way
.
i
watched
them
with
a
sense
of
soothing
,
and
a
sort
of
calm
stole
over
me
.
i
leaned
back
in
the
embrasure
in
a
more
comfortable
position
,
so
that
i
could
enjoy
more
fully
the
a
rial
gambolling
.
something
made
me
start
up
,
a
low
,
piteous
howling
of
dogs
somewhere
far
below
in
the
valley
,
which
was
hidden
from
my
sight
.
louder
it
seemed
to
ring
in
my
ears
,
and
the
floating
motes
of
dust
to
take
new
shapes
to
the
sound
as
they
danced
in
the
moonlight
.
i
felt
myself
struggling
to
awake
to
some
call
of
my
instincts
nay
,
my
very
soul
was
struggling
,
and
my
half
remembered
sensibilities
were
striving
to
answer
the
call
.
i
was
becoming
hypnotised
!
quicker
and
quicker
danced
the
dust
the
moonbeams
seemed
to
quiver
as
they
went
by
me
into
the
mass
of
gloom
beyond
.
more
and
more
they
gathered
till
they
seemed
to
take
dim
phantom
shapes
.
and
then
i
started
,
broad
awake
and
in
full
possession
of
my
senses
,
and
ran
screaming
from
the
place
.
the
phantom
shapes
,
which
were
becoming
gradually
materialised
from
the
moonbeams
,
were
those
of
the
three
ghostly
women
to
whom
i
was
doomed
.
i
fled
,
and
felt
somewhat
safer
in
my
own
room
,
where
there
was
no
moonlight
and
where
the
lamp
was
burning
brightly
.
when
a
couple
of
hours
had
passed
i
heard
something
stirring
in
the
count
s
room
,
something
like
a
sharp
wail
quickly
suppressed
and
then
there
was
silence
,
deep
,
awful
silence
,
which
chilled
me
.
with
a
beating
heart
,
i
tried
the
door
but
i
was
locked
in
my
prison
,
and
could
do
nothing
.
i
sat
down
and
simply
cried
.
as
i
sat
i
heard
a
sound
in
the
courtyard
without
the
agonised
cry
of
a
woman
.
i
rushed
to
the
window
,
and
throwing
it
up
,
peered
out
between
the
bars
.
there
,
indeed
,
was
a
woman
with
dishevelled
hair
,
holding
her
hands
over
her
heart
as
one
distressed
with
running
.
she
was
leaning
against
a
corner
of
the
gateway
.
when
she
saw
my
face
at
the
window
she
threw
herself
forward
,
and
shouted
in
a
voice
laden
with
menace
monster
,
give
me
my
child
!
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
,
and
raising
up
her
hands
,
cried
the
same
words
in
tones
which
wrung
my
heart
.
then
she
tore
her
hair
and
beat
her
breast
,
and
abandoned
herself
to
all
the
violences
of
extravagant
emotion
.
finally
,
she
threw
herself
forward
,
and
,
though
i
could
not
see
her
,
i
could
hear
the
beating
of
her
naked
hands
against
the
door
.
somewhere
high
overhead
,
probably
on
the
tower
,
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
count
calling
in
his
harsh
,
metallic
whisper
.
his
call
seemed
to
be
answered
from
far
and
wide
by
the
howling
of
wolves
.
before
many
minutes
had
passed
a
pack
of
them
poured
,
like
a
pent
up
dam
when
liberated
,
through
the
wide
entrance
into
the
courtyard
.
there
was
no
cry
from
the
woman
,
and
the
howling
of
the
wolves
was
but
short
.
before
long
they
streamed
away
singly
,
licking
their
lips
.
i
could
not
pity
her
,
for
i
knew
now
what
had
become
of
her
child
,
and
she
was
better
dead
.
what
shall
i
do
?
what
can
i
do
?
how
can
i
escape
from
this
dreadful
thing
of
night
and
gloom
and
fear
?
25
june
,
morning
.
no
man
knows
till
he
has
suffered
from
the
night
how
sweet
and
how
dear
to
his
heart
and
eye
the
morning
can
be
.
when
the
sun
grew
so
high
this
morning
that
it
struck
the
top
of
the
great
gateway
opposite
my
window
,
the
high
spot
which
it
touched
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
dove
from
the
ark
had
lighted
there
.
my
fear
fell
from
me
as
if
it
had
been
a
vaporous
garment
which
dissolved
in
the
warmth
.
i
must
take
action
of
some
sort
whilst
the
courage
of
the
day
is
upon
me
.
last
night
one
of
my
post
dated
letters
went
to
post
,
the
first
of
that
fatal
series
which
is
to
blot
out
the
very
traces
of
my
existence
from
the
earth
.
let
me
not
think
of
it
.
action
!
it
has
always
been
at
night
time
that
i
have
been
molested
or
threatened
,
or
in
some
way
in
danger
or
in
fear
.
i
have
not
yet
seen
the
count
in
the
daylight
.
can
it
be
that
he
sleeps
when
others
wake
,
that
he
may
be
awake
whilst
they
sleep
?
if
i
could
only
get
into
his
room
!
but
there
is
no
possible
way
.
the
door
is
always
locked
,
no
way
for
me
.
yes
,
there
is
a
way
,
if
one
dares
to
take
it
.
where
his
body
has
gone
why
may
not
another
body
go
?
i
have
seen
him
myself
crawl
from
his
window
.
why
should
not
i
imitate
him
,
and
go
in
by
his
window
?
the
chances
are
desperate
,
but
my
need
is
more
desperate
still
.
i
shall
risk
it
.
at
the
worst
it
can
only
be
death
and
a
man
s
death
is
not
a
calf
s
,
and
the
dreaded
hereafter
may
still
be
open
to
me
.
god
help
me
in
my
task
!
good
bye
,
mina
,
if
i
fail
good
bye
,
my
faithful
friend
and
second
father
good
bye
,
all
,
and
last
of
all
mina
!
same
day
,
later
.
i
have
made
the
effort
,
and
god
,
helping
me
,
have
come
safely
back
to
this
room
.
i
must
put
down
every
detail
in
order
.
i
went
whilst
my
courage
was
fresh
straight
to
the
window
on
the
south
side
,
and
at
once
got
outside
on
the
narrow
ledge
of
stone
which
runs
around
the
building
on
this
side
.
the
stones
are
big
and
roughly
cut
,
and
the
mortar
has
by
process
of
time
been
washed
away
between
them
.
i
took
off
my
boots
,
and
ventured
out
on
the
desperate
way
.
i
looked
down
once
,
so
as
to
make
sure
that
a
sudden
glimpse
of
the
awful
depth
would
not
overcome
me
,
but
after
that
kept
my
eyes
away
from
it
.
i
knew
pretty
well
the
direction
and
distance
of
the
count
s
window
,
and
made
for
it
as
well
as
i
could
,
having
regard
to
the
opportunities
available
.
i
did
not
feel
dizzy
i
suppose
i
was
too
excited
and
the
time
seemed
ridiculously
short
till
i
found
myself
standing
on
the
window
sill
and
trying
to
raise
up
the
sash
.
i
was
filled
with
agitation
,
however
,
when
i
bent
down
and
slid
feet
foremost
in
through
the
window
.
then
i
looked
around
for
the
count
,
but
,
with
surprise
and
gladness
,
made
a
discovery
.
the
room
was
empty
!
it
was
barely
furnished
with
odd
things
,
which
seemed
to
have
never
been
used
the
furniture
was
something
the
same
style
as
that
in
the
south
rooms
,
and
was
covered
with
dust
.
i
looked
for
the
key
,
but
it
was
not
in
the
lock
,
and
i
could
not
find
it
anywhere
.
the
only
thing
i
found
was
a
great
heap
of
gold
in
one
corner
gold
of
all
kinds
,
roman
,
and
british
,
and
austrian
,
and
hungarian
,
and
greek
and
turkish
money
,
covered
with
a
film
of
dust
,
as
though
it
had
lain
long
in
the
ground
.
none
of
it
that
i
noticed
was
less
than
three
hundred
years
old
.
there
were
also
chains
and
ornaments
,
some
jewelled
,
but
all
of
them
old
and
stained
.
at
one
corner
of
the
room
was
a
heavy
door
.
i
tried
it
,
for
,
since
i
could
not
find
the
key
of
the
room
or
the
key
of
the
outer
door
,
which
was
the
main
object
of
my
search
,
i
must
make
further
examination
,
or
all
my
efforts
would
be
in
vain
.
it
was
open
,
and
led
through
a
stone
passage
to
a
circular
stairway
,
which
went
steeply
down
.
i
descended
,
minding
carefully
where
i
went
,
for
the
stairs
were
dark
,
being
only
lit
by
loopholes
in
the
heavy
masonry
.
at
the
bottom
there
was
a
dark
,
tunnel
like
passage
,
through
which
came
a
deathly
,
sickly
odour
,
the
odour
of
old
earth
newly
turned
.
as
i
went
through
the
passage
the
smell
grew
closer
and
heavier
.
at
last
i
pulled
open
a
heavy
door
which
stood
ajar
,
and
found
myself
in
an
old
,
ruined
chapel
,
which
had
evidently
been
used
as
a
graveyard
.
the
roof
was
broken
,
and
in
two
places
were
steps
leading
to
vaults
,
but
the
ground
had
recently
been
dug
over
,
and
the
earth
placed
in
great
wooden
boxes
,
manifestly
those
which
had
been
brought
by
the
slovaks
.
there
was
nobody
about
,
and
i
made
search
for
any
further
outlet
,
but
there
was
none
.
then
i
went
over
every
inch
of
the
ground
,
so
as
not
to
lose
a
chance
.
i
went
down
even
into
the
vaults
,
where
the
dim
light
struggled
,
although
to
do
so
was
a
dread
to
my
very
soul
.
into
two
of
these
i
went
,
but
saw
nothing
except
fragments
of
old
coffins
and
piles
of
dust
in
the
third
,
however
,
i
made
a
discovery
.
there
,
in
one
of
the
great
boxes
,
of
which
there
were
fifty
in
all
,
on
a
pile
of
newly
dug
earth
,
lay
the
count
!
he
was
either
dead
or
asleep
,
i
could
not
say
which
for
the
eyes
were
open
and
stony
,
but
without
the
glassiness
of
death
and
the
cheeks
had
the
warmth
of
life
through
all
their
pallor
the
lips
were
as
red
as
ever
.
but
there
was
no
sign
of
movement
,
no
pulse
,
no
breath
,
no
beating
of
the
heart
.
i
bent
over
him
,
and
tried
to
find
any
sign
of
life
,
but
in
vain
.
he
could
not
have
lain
there
long
,
for
the
earthy
smell
would
have
passed
away
in
a
few
hours
.
by
the
side
of
the
box
was
its
cover
,
pierced
with
holes
here
and
there
.
i
thought
he
might
have
the
keys
on
him
,
but
when
i
went
to
search
i
saw
the
dead
eyes
,
and
in
them
,
dead
though
they
were
,
such
a
look
of
hate
,
though
unconscious
of
me
or
my
presence
,
that
i
fled
from
the
place
,
and
leaving
the
count
s
room
by
the
window
,
crawled
again
up
the
castle
wall
.
regaining
my
room
,
i
threw
myself
panting
upon
the
bed
and
tried
to
think
....
29
june
.
to
day
is
the
date
of
my
last
letter
,
and
the
count
has
taken
steps
to
prove
that
it
was
genuine
,
for
again
i
saw
him
leave
the
castle
by
the
same
window
,
and
in
my
clothes
.
as
he
went
down
the
wall
,
lizard
fashion
,
i
wished
i
had
a
gun
or
some
lethal
weapon
,
that
i
might
destroy
him
but
i
fear
that
no
weapon
wrought
alone
by
man
s
hand
would
have
any
effect
on
him
.
i
dared
not
wait
to
see
him
return
,
for
i
feared
to
see
those
weird
sisters
.
i
came
back
to
the
library
,
and
read
there
till
i
fell
asleep
.
i
was
awakened
by
the
count
,
who
looked
at
me
as
grimly
as
a
man
can
look
as
he
said
to
morrow
,
my
friend
,
we
must
part
.
you
return
to
your
beautiful
england
,
i
to
some
work
which
may
have
such
an
end
that
we
may
never
meet
.
your
letter
home
has
been
despatched
to
morrow
i
shall
not
be
here
,
but
all
shall
be
ready
for
your
journey
.
in
the
morning
come
the
szgany
,
who
have
some
labours
of
their
own
here
,
and
also
come
some
slovaks
.
when
they
have
gone
,
my
carriage
shall
come
for
you
,
and
shall
bear
you
to
the
borgo
pass
to
meet
the
diligence
from
bukovina
to
bistritz
.
but
i
am
in
hopes
that
i
shall
see
more
of
you
at
castle
dracula
.
i
suspected
him
,
and
determined
to
test
his
sincerity
.
sincerity
!
it
seems
like
a
profanation
of
the
word
to
write
it
in
connection
with
such
a
monster
,
so
asked
him
point
blank
why
may
i
not
go
to
night
?
because
,
dear
sir
,
my
coachman
and
horses
are
away
on
a
mission
.
but
i
would
walk
with
pleasure
.
i
want
to
get
away
at
once
.
he
smiled
,
such
a
soft
,
smooth
,
diabolical
smile
that
i
knew
there
was
some
trick
behind
his
smoothness
.
he
said
and
your
baggage
?
i
do
not
care
about
it
.
i
can
send
for
it
some
other
time
.
the
count
stood
up
,
and
said
,
with
a
sweet
courtesy
which
made
me
rub
my
eyes
,
it
seemed
so
real
you
english
have
a
saying
which
is
close
to
my
heart
,
for
its
spirit
is
that
which
rules
our
boyars
welcome
the
coming
speed
the
parting
guest
.
come
with
me
,
my
dear
young
friend
.
not
an
hour
shall
you
wait
in
my
house
against
your
will
,
though
sad
am
i
at
your
going
,
and
that
you
so
suddenly
desire
it
.
come
!
with
a
stately
gravity
,
he
,
with
the
lamp
,
preceded
me
down
the
stairs
and
along
the
hall
.
suddenly
he
stopped
.
hark
!
close
at
hand
came
the
howling
of
many
wolves
.
it
was
almost
as
if
the
sound
sprang
up
at
the
rising
of
his
hand
,
just
as
the
music
of
a
great
orchestra
seems
to
leap
under
the
b
ton
of
the
conductor
.
after
a
pause
of
a
moment
,
he
proceeded
,
in
his
stately
way
,
to
the
door
,
drew
back
the
ponderous
bolts
,
unhooked
the
heavy
chains
,
and
began
to
draw
it
open
.
to
my
intense
astonishment
i
saw
that
it
was
unlocked
.
suspiciously
,
i
looked
all
round
,
but
could
see
no
key
of
any
kind
.
as
the
door
began
to
open
,
the
howling
of
the
wolves
without
grew
louder
and
angrier
their
red
jaws
,
with
champing
teeth
,
and
their
blunt
clawed
feet
as
they
leaped
,
came
in
through
the
opening
door
.
i
knew
then
that
to
struggle
at
the
moment
against
the
count
was
useless
.
with
such
allies
as
these
at
his
command
,
i
could
do
nothing
.
but
still
the
door
continued
slowly
to
open
,
and
only
the
count
s
body
stood
in
the
gap
.
suddenly
it
struck
me
that
this
might
be
the
moment
and
means
of
my
doom
i
was
to
be
given
to
the
wolves
,
and
at
my
own
instigation
.
there
was
a
diabolical
wickedness
in
the
idea
great
enough
for
the
count
,
and
as
a
last
chance
i
cried
out
shut
the
door
i
shall
wait
till
morning
!
and
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
to
hide
my
tears
of
bitter
disappointment
.
with
one
sweep
of
his
powerful
arm
,
the
count
threw
the
door
shut
,
and
the
great
bolts
clanged
and
echoed
through
the
hall
as
they
shot
back
into
their
places
.
in
silence
we
returned
to
the
library
,
and
after
a
minute
or
two
i
went
to
my
own
room
.
the
last
i
saw
of
count
dracula
was
his
kissing
his
hand
to
me
with
a
red
light
of
triumph
in
his
eyes
,
and
with
a
smile
that
judas
in
hell
might
be
proud
of
.
when
i
was
in
my
room
and
about
to
lie
down
,
i
thought
i
heard
a
whispering
at
my
door
.
i
went
to
it
softly
and
listened
.
unless
my
ears
deceived
me
,
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
count
back
,
back
,
to
your
own
place
!
your
time
is
not
yet
come
.
wait
!
have
patience
!
to
night
is
mine
.
to
morrow
night
is
yours
!
there
was
a
low
,
sweet
ripple
of
laughter
,
and
in
a
rage
i
threw
open
the
door
,
and
saw
without
the
three
terrible
women
licking
their
lips
.
as
i
appeared
they
all
joined
in
a
horrible
laugh
,
and
ran
away
.
i
came
back
to
my
room
and
threw
myself
on
my
knees
.
it
is
then
so
near
the
end
?
to
morrow
!
to
morrow
!
lord
,
help
me
,
and
those
to
whom
i
am
dear
!
30
june
,
morning
.
these
may
be
the
last
words
i
ever
write
in
this
diary
.
i
slept
till
just
before
the
dawn
,
and
when
i
woke
threw
myself
on
my
knees
,
for
i
determined
that
if
death
came
he
should
find
me
ready
.
at
last
i
felt
that
subtle
change
in
the
air
,
and
knew
that
the
morning
had
come
.
then
came
the
welcome
cock
crow
,
and
i
felt
that
i
was
safe
.
with
a
glad
heart
,
i
opened
my
door
and
ran
down
to
the
hall
.
i
had
seen
that
the
door
was
unlocked
,
and
now
escape
was
before
me
.
with
hands
that
trembled
with
eagerness
,
i
unhooked
the
chains
and
drew
back
the
massive
bolts
.
but
the
door
would
not
move
.
despair
seized
me
.
i
pulled
,
and
pulled
,
at
the
door
,
and
shook
it
till
,
massive
as
it
was
,
it
rattled
in
its
casement
.
i
could
see
the
bolt
shot
.
it
had
been
locked
after
i
left
the
count
.
then
a
wild
desire
took
me
to
obtain
that
key
at
any
risk
,
and
i
determined
then
and
there
to
scale
the
wall
again
and
gain
the
count
s
room
.
he
might
kill
me
,
but
death
now
seemed
the
happier
choice
of
evils
.
without
a
pause
i
rushed
up
to
the
east
window
,
and
scrambled
down
the
wall
,
as
before
,
into
the
count
s
room
.
it
was
empty
,
but
that
was
as
i
expected
.
i
could
not
see
a
key
anywhere
,
but
the
heap
of
gold
remained
.
i
went
through
the
door
in
the
corner
and
down
the
winding
stair
and
along
the
dark
passage
to
the
old
chapel
.
i
knew
now
well
enough
where
to
find
the
monster
i
sought
.
the
great
box
was
in
the
same
place
,
close
against
the
wall
,
but
the
lid
was
laid
on
it
,
not
fastened
down
,
but
with
the
nails
ready
in
their
places
to
be
hammered
home
.
i
knew
i
must
reach
the
body
for
the
key
,
so
i
raised
the
lid
,
and
laid
it
back
against
the
wall
and
then
i
saw
something
which
filled
my
very
soul
with
horror
.
there
lay
the
count
,
but
looking
as
if
his
youth
had
been
half
renewed
,
for
the
white
hair
and
moustache
were
changed
to
dark
iron
grey
the
cheeks
were
fuller
,
and
the
white
skin
seemed
ruby
red
underneath
the
mouth
was
redder
than
ever
,
for
on
the
lips
were
gouts
of
fresh
blood
,
which
trickled
from
the
corners
of
the
mouth
and
ran
over
the
chin
and
neck
.
even
the
deep
,
burning
eyes
seemed
set
amongst
swollen
flesh
,
for
the
lids
and
pouches
underneath
were
bloated
.
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
awful
creature
were
simply
gorged
with
blood
.
he
lay
like
a
filthy
leech
,
exhausted
with
his
repletion
.
i
shuddered
as
i
bent
over
to
touch
him
,
and
every
sense
in
me
revolted
at
the
contact
but
i
had
to
search
,
or
i
was
lost
.
the
coming
night
might
see
my
own
body
a
banquet
in
a
similar
way
to
those
horrid
three
.
i
felt
all
over
the
body
,
but
no
sign
could
i
find
of
the
key
.
then
i
stopped
and
looked
at
the
count
.
there
was
a
mocking
smile
on
the
bloated
face
which
seemed
to
drive
me
mad
.
this
was
the
being
i
was
helping
to
transfer
to
london
,
where
,
perhaps
,
for
centuries
to
come
he
might
,
amongst
its
teeming
millions
,
satiate
his
lust
for
blood
,
and
create
a
new
and
ever
widening
circle
of
semi
demons
to
batten
on
the
helpless
.
the
very
thought
drove
me
mad
.
a
terrible
desire
came
upon
me
to
rid
the
world
of
such
a
monster
.
there
was
no
lethal
weapon
at
hand
,
but
i
seized
a
shovel
which
the
workmen
had
been
using
to
fill
the
cases
,
and
lifting
it
high
,
struck
,
with
the
edge
downward
,
at
the
hateful
face
.
but
as
i
did
so
the
head
turned
,
and
the
eyes
fell
full
upon
me
,
with
all
their
blaze
of
basilisk
horror
.
the
sight
seemed
to
paralyse
me
,
and
the
shovel
turned
in
my
hand
and
glanced
from
the
face
,
merely
making
a
deep
gash
above
the
forehead
.
the
shovel
fell
from
my
hand
across
the
box
,
and
as
i
pulled
it
away
the
flange
of
the
blade
caught
the
edge
of
the
lid
which
fell
over
again
,
and
hid
the
horrid
thing
from
my
sight
.
the
last
glimpse
i
had
was
of
the
bloated
face
,
blood
stained
and
fixed
with
a
grin
of
malice
which
would
have
held
its
own
in
the
nethermost
hell
.
i
thought
and
thought
what
should
be
my
next
move
,
but
my
brain
seemed
on
fire
,
and
i
waited
with
a
despairing
feeling
growing
over
me
.
as
i
waited
i
heard
in
the
distance
a
gipsy
song
sung
by
merry
voices
coming
closer
,
and
through
their
song
the
rolling
of
heavy
wheels
and
the
cracking
of
whips
the
szgany
and
the
slovaks
of
whom
the
count
had
spoken
were
coming
.
with
a
last
look
around
and
at
the
box
which
contained
the
vile
body
,
i
ran
from
the
place
and
gained
the
count
s
room
,
determined
to
rush
out
at
the
moment
the
door
should
be
opened
.
with
strained
ears
,
i
listened
,
and
heard
downstairs
the
grinding
of
the
key
in
the
great
lock
and
the
falling
back
of
the
heavy
door
.
there
must
have
been
some
other
means
of
entry
,
or
some
one
had
a
key
for
one
of
the
locked
doors
.
then
there
came
the
sound
of
many
feet
tramping
and
dying
away
in
some
passage
which
sent
up
a
clanging
echo
.
i
turned
to
run
down
again
towards
the
vault
,
where
i
might
find
the
new
entrance
but
at
the
moment
there
seemed
to
come
a
violent
puff
of
wind
,
and
the
door
to
the
winding
stair
blew
to
with
a
shock
that
set
the
dust
from
the
lintels
flying
.
when
i
ran
to
push
it
open
,
i
found
that
it
was
hopelessly
fast
.
i
was
again
a
prisoner
,
and
the
net
of
doom
was
closing
round
me
more
closely
.
as
i
write
there
is
in
the
passage
below
a
sound
of
many
tramping
feet
and
the
crash
of
weights
being
set
down
heavily
,
doubtless
the
boxes
,
with
their
freight
of
earth
.
there
is
a
sound
of
hammering
it
is
the
box
being
nailed
down
.
now
i
can
hear
the
heavy
feet
tramping
again
along
the
hall
,
with
many
other
idle
feet
coming
behind
them
.
the
door
is
shut
,
and
the
chains
rattle
there
is
a
grinding
of
the
key
in
the
lock
i
can
hear
the
key
withdraw
then
another
door
opens
and
shuts
i
hear
the
creaking
of
lock
and
bolt
.
hark
!
in
the
courtyard
and
down
the
rocky
way
the
roll
of
heavy
wheels
,
the
crack
of
whips
,
and
the
chorus
of
the
szgany
as
they
pass
into
the
distance
.
i
am
alone
in
the
castle
with
those
awful
women
.
faugh
!
mina
is
a
woman
,
and
there
is
nought
in
common
.
they
are
devils
of
the
pit
!
i
shall
not
remain
alone
with
them
i
shall
try
to
scale
the
castle
wall
farther
than
i
have
yet
attempted
.
i
shall
take
some
of
the
gold
with
me
,
lest
i
want
it
later
.
i
may
find
a
way
from
this
dreadful
place
.
and
then
away
for
home
!
away
to
the
quickest
and
nearest
train
!
away
from
this
cursed
spot
,
from
this
cursed
land
,
where
the
devil
and
his
children
still
walk
with
earthly
feet
!
at
least
god
s
mercy
is
better
than
that
of
these
monsters
,
and
the
precipice
is
steep
and
high
.
at
its
foot
a
man
may
sleep
as
a
man
.
good
bye
,
all
!

chapter
v
letter
from
miss
mina
murray
to
miss
lucy
westenra
.
9
may
.
my
dearest
lucy
,
forgive
my
long
delay
in
writing
,
but
i
have
been
simply
overwhelmed
with
work
.
the
life
of
an
assistant
schoolmistress
is
sometimes
trying
.
i
am
longing
to
be
with
you
,
and
by
the
sea
,
where
we
can
talk
together
freely
and
build
our
castles
in
the
air
.
i
have
been
working
very
hard
lately
,
because
i
want
to
keep
up
with
jonathan
s
studies
,
and
i
have
been
practising
shorthand
very
assiduously
.
when
we
are
married
i
shall
be
able
to
be
useful
to
jonathan
,
and
if
i
can
stenograph
well
enough
i
can
take
down
what
he
wants
to
say
in
this
way
and
write
it
out
for
him
on
the
typewriter
,
at
which
also
i
am
practising
very
hard
.
he
and
i
sometimes
write
letters
in
shorthand
,
and
he
is
keeping
a
stenographic
journal
of
his
travels
abroad
.
when
i
am
with
you
i
shall
keep
a
diary
in
the
same
way
.
i
don
t
mean
one
of
those
two
pages
to
the
week
with
sunday
squeezed
in
a
corner
diaries
,
but
a
sort
of
journal
which
i
can
write
in
whenever
i
feel
inclined
.
i
do
not
suppose
there
will
be
much
of
interest
to
other
people
but
it
is
not
intended
for
them
.
i
may
show
it
to
jonathan
some
day
if
there
is
in
it
anything
worth
sharing
,
but
it
is
really
an
exercise
book
.
i
shall
try
to
do
what
i
see
lady
journalists
do
interviewing
and
writing
descriptions
and
trying
to
remember
conversations
.
i
am
told
that
,
with
a
little
practice
,
one
can
remember
all
that
goes
on
or
that
one
hears
said
during
a
day
.
however
,
we
shall
see
.
i
will
tell
you
of
my
little
plans
when
we
meet
.
i
have
just
had
a
few
hurried
lines
from
jonathan
from
transylvania
.
he
is
well
,
and
will
be
returning
in
about
a
week
.
i
am
longing
to
hear
all
his
news
.
it
must
be
so
nice
to
see
strange
countries
.
i
wonder
if
we
i
mean
jonathan
and
i
shall
ever
see
them
together
.
there
is
the
ten
o
clock
bell
ringing
.
good
bye
.
your
loving
mina
.
tell
me
all
the
news
when
you
write
.
you
have
not
told
me
anything
for
a
long
time
.
i
hear
rumours
,
and
especially
of
a
tall
,
handsome
,
curly
haired
man
???

chatham
street
,
wednesday
.
my
dearest
mina
,
i
must
say
you
tax
me
very
unfairly
with
being
a
bad
correspondent
.
i
wrote
to
you
twice
since
we
parted
,
and
your
last
letter
was
only
your
second
.
besides
,
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
.
there
is
really
nothing
to
interest
you
.
town
is
very
pleasant
just
now
,
and
we
go
a
good
deal
to
picture
galleries
and
for
walks
and
rides
in
the
park
.
as
to
the
tall
,
curly
haired
man
,
i
suppose
it
was
the
one
who
was
with
me
at
the
last
pop
.
some
one
has
evidently
been
telling
tales
.
that
was
mr
.
holmwood
.
he
often
comes
to
see
us
,
and
he
and
mamma
get
on
very
well
together
they
have
so
many
things
to
talk
about
in
common
.
we
met
some
time
ago
a
man
that
would
just
do
for
you
,
if
you
were
not
already
engaged
to
jonathan
.
he
is
an
excellent
parti
,
being
handsome
,
well
off
,
and
of
good
birth
.
he
is
a
doctor
and
really
clever
.
just
fancy
!
he
is
only
nine
and
twenty
,
and
he
has
an
immense
lunatic
asylum
all
under
his
own
care
.
mr
.
holmwood
introduced
him
to
me
,
and
he
called
here
to
see
us
,
and
often
comes
now
.
i
think
he
is
one
of
the
most
resolute
men
i
ever
saw
,
and
yet
the
most
calm
.
he
seems
absolutely
imperturbable
.
i
can
fancy
what
a
wonderful
power
he
must
have
over
his
patients
.
he
has
a
curious
habit
of
looking
one
straight
in
the
face
,
as
if
trying
to
read
one
s
thoughts
.
he
tries
this
on
very
much
with
me
,
but
i
flatter
myself
he
has
got
a
tough
nut
to
crack
.
i
know
that
from
my
glass
.
do
you
ever
try
to
read
your
own
face
?
i
do
,
and
i
can
tell
you
it
is
not
a
bad
study
,
and
gives
you
more
trouble
than
you
can
well
fancy
if
you
have
never
tried
it
.
he
says
that
i
afford
him
a
curious
psychological
study
,
and
i
humbly
think
i
do
.
i
do
not
,
as
you
know
,
take
sufficient
interest
in
dress
to
be
able
to
describe
the
new
fashions
.
dress
is
a
bore
.
that
is
slang
again
,
but
never
mind
arthur
says
that
every
day
.
there
,
it
is
all
out
.
mina
,
we
have
told
all
our
secrets
to
each
other
since
we
were
children
we
have
slept
together
and
eaten
together
,
and
laughed
and
cried
together
and
now
,
though
i
have
spoken
,
i
would
like
to
speak
more
.
oh
,
mina
,
couldn
t
you
guess
?
i
love
him
.
i
am
blushing
as
i
write
,
for
although
i
think
he
loves
me
,
he
has
not
told
me
so
in
words
.
but
oh
,
mina
,
i
love
him
i
love
him
i
love
him
!
there
,
that
does
me
good
.
i
wish
i
were
with
you
,
dear
,
sitting
by
the
fire
undressing
,
as
we
used
to
sit
and
i
would
try
to
tell
you
what
i
feel
.
i
do
not
know
how
i
am
writing
this
even
to
you
.
i
am
afraid
to
stop
,
or
i
should
tear
up
the
letter
,
and
i
don
t
want
to
stop
,
for
i
do
so
want
to
tell
you
all
.
let
me
hear
from
you
at
once
,
and
tell
me
all
that
you
think
about
it
.
mina
,
i
must
stop
.
good
night
.
bless
me
in
your
prayers
and
,
mina
,
pray
for
my
happiness
.

i
need
not
tell
you
this
is
a
secret
.
good
night
again

and
to
have
your
sympathy
.
my

proverbs

and

one
day

to
do
with
myself
.
and
three
proposals
!
but
,
for
goodness
sake
,
don
t
tell
any
of
the
girls
,
or
they
would
be
getting
all
sorts
of
extravagant
ideas
and
imagining
themselves
injured
and
slighted
if
in
their
very
first
day
at
home
they
did
not
get
six
at
least
.
some
girls
are
so
vain
!
you
and
i
,
mina
dear
,
who
are
engaged
and
are
going
to
settle
down
soon
soberly
into
old
married
women
,
can
despise
vanity
.
well
,
i
must
tell
you
about
the
three
,
but
you
must
keep
it
a
secret
,
dear
,
from
every
one
,
except
,
of
course
,
jonathan
.
you
will
tell
him
,
because
i
would
,
if
i
were
in
your
place
,
certainly
tell
arthur
.
a
woman
ought
to
tell
her
husband
everything
don
t
you
think
so
,
dear
?
and
i
must
be
fair
.
men
like
women
,
certainly
their
wives
,
to
be
quite
as
fair
as
they
are
and
women
,
i
am
afraid
,
are
not
always
quite
as
fair
as
they
should
be
.
well
,
my
dear
,
number
one
came
just
before
lunch
.
i
told
you
of
him
,
dr
.
john
seward
,
the
lunatic
asylum
man
,
with
the
strong
jaw
and
the
good
forehead
.
he
was
very
cool
outwardly
,
but
was
nervous
all
the
same
.
he
had
evidently
been
schooling
himself
as
to
all
sorts
of
little
things
,
and
remembered
them
but
he
almost
managed
to
sit
down
on
his
silk
hat
,
which
men
don
t
generally
do
when
they
are
cool
,
and
then
when
he
wanted
to
appear
at
ease
he
kept
playing
with
a
lancet
in
a
way
that
made
me
nearly
scream
.
he
spoke
to
me
,
mina
,
very
straightforwardly
.
he
told
me
how
dear
i
was
to
him
,
though
he
had
known
me
so
little
,
and
what
his
life
would
be
with
me
to
help
and
cheer
him
.
he
was
going
to
tell
me
how
unhappy
he
would
be
if
i
did
not
care
for
him
,
but
when
he
saw
me
cry
he
said
that
he
was
a
brute
and
would
not
add
to
my
present
trouble
.
then
he
broke
off
and
asked
if
i
could
love
him
in
time
and
when
i
shook
my
head
his
hands
trembled
,
and
then
with
some
hesitation
he
asked
me
if
i
cared
already
for
any
one
else
.
he
put
it
very
nicely
,
saying
that
he
did
not
want
to
wring
my
confidence
from
me
,
but
only
to
know
,
because
if
a
woman
s
heart
was
free
a
man
might
have
hope
.
and
then
,
mina
,
i
felt
a
sort
of
duty
to
tell
him
that
there
was
some
one
.
i
only
told
him
that
much
,
and
then
he
stood
up
,
and
he
looked
very
strong
and
very
grave
as
he
took
both
my
hands
in
his
and
said
he
hoped
i
would
be
happy
,
and
that
if
i
ever
wanted
a
friend
i
must
count
him
one
of
my
best
.
oh
,
mina
dear
,
i
can
t
help
crying
and
you
must
excuse
this
letter
being
all
blotted
.
being
proposed
to
is
all
very
nice
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
but
it
isn
t
at
all
a
happy
thing
when
you
have
to
see
a
poor
fellow
,
whom
you
know
loves
you
honestly
,
going
away
and
looking
all
broken
hearted
,
and
to
know
that
,
no
matter
what
he
may
say
at
the
moment
,
you
are
passing
quite
out
of
his
life
.
my
dear
,
i
must
stop
here
at
present
,
i
feel
so
miserable
,
though
i
am
so
happy
.
evening
.
arthur
has
just
gone
,
and
i
feel
in
better
spirits
than
when
i
left
off
,
so
i
can
go
on
telling
you
about
the
day
.
well
,
my
dear
,
number
two
came
after
lunch
.
he
is
such
a
nice
fellow
,
an
american
from
texas
,
and
he
looks
so
young
and
so
fresh
that
it
seems
almost
impossible
that
he
has
been
to
so
many
places
and
has
had
such
adventures
.
i
sympathise
with
poor
desdemona
when
she
had
such
a
dangerous
stream
poured
in
her
ear
,
even
by
a
black
man
.
i
suppose
that
we
women
are
such
cowards
that
we
think
a
man
will
save
us
from
fears
,
and
we
marry
him
.
i
know
now
what
i
would
do
if
i
were
a
man
and
wanted
to
make
a
girl
love
me
.
no
,
i
don
t
,
for
there
was
mr
.
morris
telling
us
his
stories
,
and
arthur
never
told
any
,
and
yet
my
dear
,
i
am
somewhat
previous
.
mr
.
quincey
p
.
morris
found
me
alone
.
it
seems
that
a
man
always
does
find
a
girl
alone
.
no
,
he
doesn
t
,
for
arthur
tried
twice
to
make
a
chance
,
and
i
helping
him
all
i
could
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
it
now
.
i
must
tell
you
beforehand
that
mr
.
morris
doesn
t
always
speak
slang
that
is
to
say
,
he
never
does
so
to
strangers
or
before
them
,
for
he
is
really
well
educated
and
has
exquisite
manners
but
he
found
out
that
it
amused
me
to
hear
him
talk
american
slang
,
and
whenever
i
was
present
,
and
there
was
no
one
to
be
shocked
,
he
said
such
funny
things
.
i
am
afraid
,
my
dear
,
he
has
to
invent
it
all
,
for
it
fits
exactly
into
whatever
else
he
has
to
say
.
but
this
is
a
way
slang
has
.
i
do
not
know
myself
if
i
shall
ever
speak
slang
i
do
not
know
if
arthur
likes
it
,
as
i
have
never
heard
him
use
any
as
yet
.
well
,
mr
.
morris
sat
down
beside
me
and
looked
as
happy
and
jolly
as
he
could
,
but
i
could
see
all
the
same
that
he
was
very
nervous
.
he
took
my
hand
in
his
,
and
said
ever
so
sweetly
miss
lucy
,
i
know
i
ain
t
good
enough
to
regulate
the
fixin
s
of
your
little
shoes
,
but
i
guess
if
you
wait
till
you
find
a
man
that
is
you
will
go
join
them
seven
young
women
with
the
lamps
when
you
quit
.
won
t
you
just
hitch
up
alongside
of
me
and
let
us
go
down
the
long
road
together
,
driving
in
double
harness
?
well
,
he
did
look
so
good
humoured
and
so
jolly
that
it
didn
t
seem
half
so
hard
to
refuse
him
as
it
did
poor
dr
.
seward
so
i
said
,
as
lightly
as
i
could
,
that
i
did
not
know
anything
of
hitching
,
and
that
i
wasn
t
broken
to
harness
at
all
yet
.
then
he
said
that
he
had
spoken
in
a
light
manner
,
and
he
hoped
that
if
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
doing
so
on
so
grave
,
so
momentous
,
an
occasion
for
him
,
i
would
forgive
him
.
he
really
did
look
serious
when
he
was
saying
it
,
and
i
couldn
t
help
feeling
a
bit
serious
too
i
know
,
mina
,
you
will
think
me
a
horrid
flirt
though
i
couldn
t
help
feeling
a
sort
of
exultation
that
he
was
number
two
in
one
day
.
and
then
,
my
dear
,
before
i
could
say
a
word
he
began
pouring
out
a
perfect
torrent
of
love
making
,
laying
his
very
heart
and
soul
at
my
feet
.
he
looked
so
earnest
over
it
that
i
shall
never
again
think
that
a
man
must
be
playful
always
,
and
never
earnest
,
because
he
is
merry
at
times
.
i
suppose
he
saw
something
in
my
face
which
checked
him
,
for
he
suddenly
stopped
,
and
said
with
a
sort
of
manly
fervour
that
i
could
have
loved
him
for
if
i
had
been
free
lucy
,
you
are
an
honest
hearted
girl
,
i
know
.
i
should
not
be
here
speaking
to
you
as
i
am
now
if
i
did
not
believe
you
clean
grit
,
right
through
to
the
very
depths
of
your
soul
.
tell
me
,
like
one
good
fellow
to
another
,
is
there
any
one
else
that
you
care
for
?
and
if
there
is
i
ll
never
trouble
you
a
hair
s
breadth
again
,
but
will
be
,
if
you
will
let
me
,
a
very
faithful
friend
.
my
dear
mina
,
why
are
men
so
noble
when
we
women
are
so
little
worthy
of
them
?
here
was
i
almost
making
fun
of
this
great
hearted
,
true
gentleman
.
i
burst
into
tears
i
am
afraid
,
my
dear
,
you
will
think
this
a
very
sloppy
letter
in
more
ways
than
one
and
i
really
felt
very
badly
.
why
can
t
they
let
a
girl
marry
three
men
,
or
as
many
as
want
her
,
and
save
all
this
trouble
?
but
this
is
heresy
,
and
i
must
not
say
it
.
i
am
glad
to
say
that
,
though
i
was
crying
,
i
was
able
to
look
into
mr
.
morris
s
brave
eyes
,
and
i
told
him
out
straight
yes
,
there
is
some
one
i
love
,
though
he
has
not
told
me
yet
that
he
even
loves
me
.
i
was
right
to
speak
to
him
so
frankly
,
for
quite
a
light
came
into
his
face
,
and
he
put
out
both
his
hands
and
took
mine
i
think
i
put
them
into
his
and
said
in
a
hearty
way
that
s
my
brave
girl
.
it
s
better
worth
being
late
for
a
chance
of
winning
you
than
being
in
time
for
any
other
girl
in
the
world
.
don
t
cry
,
my
dear
.
if
it
s
for
me
,
i
m
a
hard
nut
to
crack
and
i
take
it
standing
up
.
if
that
other
fellow
doesn
t
know
his
happiness
,
well
,
he
d
better
look
for
it
soon
,
or
he
ll
have
to
deal
with
me
.
little
girl
,
your
honesty
and
pluck
have
made
me
a
friend
,
and
that
s
rarer
than
a
lover
it
s
more
unselfish
anyhow
.
my
dear
,
i
m
going
to
have
a
pretty
lonely
walk
between
this
and
kingdom
come
.
won
t
you
give
me
one
kiss
?
it
ll
be
something
to
keep
off
the
darkness
now
and
then
.
you
can
,
you
know
,
if
you
like
,
for
that
other
good
fellow
he
must
be
a
good
fellow
,
my
dear
,
and
a
fine
fellow
,
or
you
could
not
love
him
hasn
t
spoken
yet
.
that
quite
won
me
,
mina
,
for
it
was
brave
and
sweet
of
him
,
and
noble
,
too
,
to
a
rival
wasn
t
it
?
and
he
so
sad
so
i
leant
over
and
kissed
him
.
he
stood
up
with
my
two
hands
in
his
,
and
as
he
looked
down
into
my
face
i
am
afraid
i
was
blushing
very
much
he
said
little
girl
,
i
hold
your
hand
,
and
you
ve
kissed
me
,
and
if
these
things
don
t
make
us
friends
nothing
ever
will
.
thank
you
for
your
sweet
honesty
to
me
,
and
good
bye
.
he
wrung
my
hand
,
and
taking
up
his
hat
,
went
straight
out
of
the
room
without
looking
back
,
without
a
tear
or
a
quiver
or
a
pause
and
i
am
crying
like
a
baby
.
oh
,
why
must
a
man
like
that
be
made
unhappy
when
there
are
lots
of
girls
about
who
would
worship
the
very
ground
he
trod
on
?
i
know
i
would
if
i
were
free
only
i
don
t
want
to
be
free
.
my
dear
,
this
quite
upset
me
,
and
i
feel
i
cannot
write
of
happiness
just
at
once
,
after
telling
you
of
it
and
i
don
t
wish
to
tell
of
the
number
three
until
it
can
be
all
happy
.
ever
your
loving
lucy
.
p
.s
.
oh
,
about
number
three
i
needn
t
tell
you
of
number
three
,
need
i
?
besides
,
it
was
all
so
confused
it
seemed
only
a
moment
from
his
coming
into
the
room
till
both
his
arms
were
round
me
,
and
he
was
kissing
me
.
i
am
very
,
very
happy
,
and
i
don
t
know
what
i
have
done
to
deserve
it
.
i
must
only
try
in
the
future
to
show
that
i
am
not
ungrateful
to
god
for
all
his
goodness
to
me
in
sending
to
me
such
a
lover
,
such
a
husband
,
and
such
a
friend

since
my
rebuff
of
yesterday
i
have
a
sort
of
empty
feeling
nothing
in
the
world
seems
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
worth
the
doing
....
as
i
knew
that
the
only
cure
for
this
sort
of
thing
was
work
,
i
went
down
amongst
the
patients
.
i
picked
out
one
who
has
afforded
me
a
study
of
much
interest
.
he
is
so
quaint
that
i
am
determined
to
understand
him
as
well
as
i
can
.
to
day
i
seemed
to
get
nearer
than
ever
before
to
the
heart
of
his
mystery
.
i
questioned
him
more
fully
than
i
had
ever
done
,
with
a
view
to
making
myself
master
of
the
facts
of
his
hallucination
.
in
my
manner
of
doing
it
there
was
,
i
now
see
,
something
of
cruelty
.
i
seemed
to
wish
to
keep
him
to
the
point
of
his
madness
a
thing
which
i
avoid
with
the
patients
as
i
would
the
mouth
of
hell

,
under
what
circumstances
would
i
not

whitby
.
lucy
met
me
at
the
station
,
looking
sweeter
and
lovelier
than
ever
,
and
we
drove
up
to
the
house
at
the
crescent
in
which
they
have
rooms
.
this
is
a
lovely
place
.
the
little
river
,
the
esk
,
runs
through
a
deep
valley
,
which
broadens
out
as
it
comes
near
the
harbour
.
a
great
viaduct
runs
across
,
with
high
piers
,
through
which
the
view
seems
somehow
further
away
than
it
really
is
.
the
valley
is
beautifully
green
,
and
it
is
so
steep
that
when
you
are
on
the
high
land
on
either
side
you
look
right
across
it
,
unless
you
are
near
enough
to
see
down
.
the
houses
of
the
old
town
the
side
away
from
us
are
all
red
roofed
,
and
seem
piled
up
one
over
the
other
anyhow
,
like
the
pictures
we
see
of
nuremberg
.
right
over
the
town
is
the
ruin
of
whitby
abbey
,
which
was
sacked
by
the
danes
,
and
which
is
the
scene
of
part
of
marmion
,
where
the
girl
was
built
up
in
the
wall
.
it
is
a
most
noble
ruin
,
of
immense
size
,
and
full
of
beautiful
and
romantic
bits
there
is
a
legend
that
a
white
lady
is
seen
in
one
of
the
windows
.
between
it
and
the
town
there
is
another
church
,
the
parish
one
,
round
which
is
a
big
graveyard
,
all
full
of
tombstones
.
this
is
to
my
mind
the
nicest
spot
in
whitby
,
for
it
lies
right
over
the
town
,
and
has
a
full
view
of
the
harbour
and
all
up
the
bay
to
where
the
headland
called
kettleness
stretches
out
into
the
sea
.
it
descends
so
steeply
over
the
harbour
that
part
of
the
bank
has
fallen
away
,
and
some
of
the
graves
have
been
destroyed
.
in
one
place
part
of
the
stonework
of
the
graves
stretches
out
over
the
sandy
pathway
far
below
.
there
are
walks
,
with
seats
beside
them
,
through
the
churchyard
and
people
go
and
sit
there
all
day
long
looking
at
the
beautiful
view
and
enjoying
the
breeze
.
i
shall
come
and
sit
here
very
often
myself
and
work
.
indeed
,
i
am
writing
now
,
with
my
book
on
my
knee
,
and
listening
to
the
talk
of
three
old
men
who
are
sitting
beside
me
.
they
seem
to
do
nothing
all
day
but
sit
up
here
and
talk
.
the
harbour
lies
below
me
,
with
,
on
the
far
side
,
one
long
granite
wall
stretching
out
into
the
sea
,
with
a
curve
outwards
at
the
end
of
it
,
in
the
middle
of
which
is
a
lighthouse
.
a
heavy
sea
wall
runs
along
outside
of
it
.
on
the
near
side
,
the
sea
wall
makes
an
elbow
crooked
inversely
,
and
its
end
too
has
a
lighthouse
.
between
the
two
piers
there
is
a
narrow
opening
into
the
harbour
,
which
then
suddenly
widens
.
it
is
nice
at
high
water
but
when
the
tide
is
out
it
shoals
away
to
nothing
,
and
there
is
merely
the
stream
of
the
esk
,
running
between
banks
of
sand
,
with
rocks
here
and
there
.
outside
the
harbour
on
this
side
there
rises
for
about
half
a
mile
a
great
reef
,
the
sharp
edge
of
which
runs
straight
out
from
behind
the
south
lighthouse
.
at
the
end
of
it
is
a
buoy
with
a
bell
,
which
swings
in
bad
weather
,
and
sends
in
a
mournful
sound
on
the
wind
.
they
have
a
legend
here
that
when
a
ship
is
lost
bells
are
heard
out
at
sea
.
i
must
ask
the
old
man
about
this
he
is
coming
this
way
....
he
is
a
funny
old
man
.
he
must
be
awfully
old
,
for
his
face
is
all
gnarled
and
twisted
like
the
bark
of
a
tree
.
he
tells
me
that
he
is
nearly
a
hundred
,
and
that
he
was
a
sailor
in
the
greenland
fishing
fleet
when
waterloo
was
fought
.
he
is
,
i
am
afraid
,
a
very
sceptical
person
,
for
when
i
asked
him
about
the
bells
at
sea
and
the
white
lady
at
the
abbey
he
said
very
brusquely
i
wouldn
t
fash
masel
about
them
,
miss
.
them
things
be
all
wore
out
.
mind
,
i
don
t
say
that
they
never
was
,
but
i
do
say
that
they
wasn
t
in
my
time
.
they
be
all
very
well
for
comers
and
trippers
,
an
the
like
,
but
not
for
a
nice
young
lady
like
you
.
them
feet
folks
from
york
and
leeds
that
be
always
eatin
cured
herrin
s
an
drinkin
tea
an
lookin
out
to
buy
cheap
jet
would
creed
aught
.
i
wonder
masel
who
d
be
bothered
tellin
lies
to
them
even
the
newspapers
,
which
is
full
of
fool
talk
.
i
thought
he
would
be
a
good
person
to
learn
interesting
things
from
,
so
i
asked
him
if
he
would
mind
telling
me
something
about
the
whale
fishing
in
the
old
days
.
he
was
just
settling
himself
to
begin
when
the
clock
struck
six
,
whereupon
he
laboured
to
get
up
,
and
said
i
must
gang
ageeanwards
home
now
,
miss
.
my
grand
daughter
doesn
t
like
to
be
kept
waitin
when
the
tea
is
ready
,
for
it
takes
me
time
to
crammle
aboon
the
grees
,
for
there
be
a
many
of
em
an
,
miss
,
i
lack
belly
timber
sairly
by
the
clock
.
he
hobbled
away
,
and
i
could
see
him
hurrying
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
down
the
steps
.
the
steps
are
a
great
feature
on
the
place
.
they
lead
from
the
town
up
to
the
church
,
there
are
hundreds
of
them
i
do
not
know
how
many
and
they
wind
up
in
a
delicate
curve
the
slope
is
so
gentle
that
a
horse
could
easily
walk
up
and
down
them
.
i
think
they
must
originally
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
abbey
.
i
shall
go
home
too
.
lucy
went
out
visiting
with
her
mother
,
and
as
they
were
only
duty
calls
,
i
did
not
go
.
they
will
be
home
by
this
.
1
august
.
i
came
up
here
an
hour
ago
with
lucy
,
and
we
had
a
most
interesting
talk
with
my
old
friend
and
the
two
others
who
always
come
and
join
him
.
he
is
evidently
the
sir
oracle
of
them
,
and
i
should
think
must
have
been
in
his
time
a
most
dictatorial
person
.
he
will
not
admit
anything
,
and
downfaces
everybody
.
if
he
can
t
out
argue
them
he
bullies
them
,
and
then
takes
their
silence
for
agreement
with
his
views
.
lucy
was
looking
sweetly
pretty
in
her
white
lawn
frock
she
has
got
a
beautiful
colour
since
she
has
been
here
.
i
noticed
that
the
old
men
did
not
lose
any
time
in
coming
up
and
sitting
near
her
when
we
sat
down
.
she
is
so
sweet
with
old
people
i
think
they
all
fell
in
love
with
her
on
the
spot
.
even
my
old
man
succumbed
and
did
not
contradict
her
,
but
gave
me
double
share
instead
.
i
got
him
on
the
subject
of
the
legends
,
and
he
went
off
at
once
into
a
sort
of
sermon
.
i
must
try
to
remember
it
and
put
it
down
it
be
all
fool
talk
,
lock
,
stock
,
and
barrel
that
s
what
it
be
,
an
nowt
else
.
these
bans
an
wafts
an
boh
ghosts
an
barguests
an
bogles
an
all
anent
them
is
only
fit
to
set
bairns
an
dizzy
women
a
belderin
.
they
be

but

.
they
,
an

an
to
get
folks
to
do
somethin
that
they
don

other
incline
to
.
it
makes
me
ireful
to
think
o
them
.
why
,
it
s
them
that
,
not
content
with
printin
lies
on
paper
an
preachin
them
out
of
pulpits
,
does
want
to
be
cuttin
them
on
the
tombstones
.
look
here
all
around
you
in
what
airt
ye
will
all
them
steans
,
holdin
up
their
heads
as
well
as
they
can
out
of
their
pride
,
is
acant
simply
tumblin
down
with
the
weight
o
the
lies
wrote
on
them
,
here
lies
the
body
or
sacred
to
the
memory
wrote
on
all
of
them
,
an
yet
in
nigh
half
of
them
there
bean
t
no
bodies
at
all
an
the
memories
of
them
bean
t
cared
a
pinch
of
snuff
about
,
much
less
sacred
.
lies
all
of
them
,
nothin
but
lies
of
one
kind
or
another
!
my
gog
,
but
it
ll
be
a
quare
scowderment
at
the
day
of
judgment
when
they
come
tumblin
up
in
their
death
sarks
,
all
jouped
together
an
tryin
to
drag
their
tombsteans
with
them
to
prove
how
good
they
was
some
of
them
trimmlin
and
ditherin
,
with
their
hands
that
dozzened
an
slippy
from
lyin
in
the
sea
that
they
can
t
even
keep
their
grup
o
them
.
i
could
see
from
the
old
fellow
s
self
satisfied
air
and
the
way
in
which
he
looked
round
for
the
approval
of
his
cronies
that
he
was
showing
off
,
so
i
put
in
a
word
to
keep
him
going
oh
,
mr
.
swales
,
you
can
t
be
serious
.
surely
these
tombstones
are
not
all
wrong
?
yabblins
!
there
may
be
a
poorish
few
not
wrong
,
savin
where
they
make
out
the
people
too
good
for
there
be
folk
that
do
think
a
balm
bowl
be
like
the
sea
,
if
only
it
be
their
own
.
the
whole
thing
be
only
lies
.
now
look
you
here
you
come
here
a
stranger
,
an
you
see
this
kirk
garth
.
i
nodded
,
for
i
thought
it
better
to
assent
,
though
i
did
not
quite
understand
his
dialect
.
i
knew
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
church
.
he
went
on
and
you
consate
that
all
these
steans
be
aboon
folk
that
be
happed
here
,
snod
an
snog
?
i
assented
again
.
then
that
be
just
where
the
lie
comes
in
.
why
,
there
be
scores
of
these
lay
beds
that
be
toom
as
old
dun
s
bacca
box
on
friday
night
.
he
nudged
one
of
his
companions
,
and
they
all
laughed
.
and
my
gog
!
how
could
they
be
otherwise
?
look
at
that
one
,
the
aftest
abaft
the
bier
bank
read
it
!
i
went
over
and
read
edward
spencelagh
,
master
mariner
,
murdered
by
pirates
off
the
coast
of
andres
,
april
,
1854
,
t
.
30
.
when
i
came
back
mr
.
swales
went
on
who
brought
him
home
,
i
wonder
,
to
hap
him
here
?
murdered
off
the
coast
of
andres
!
an
you
consated
his
body
lay
under
!
why
,
i
could
name
ye
a
dozen
whose
bones
lie
in
the
greenland
seas
above
he
pointed
northwards
or
where
the
currents
may
have
drifted
them
.
there
be
the
steans
around
ye
.
ye
can
,
with
your
young
eyes
,
read
the
small
print
of
the
lies
from
here
.
this
braithwaite
lowrey
i
knew
his
father
,
lost
in
the
lively
off
greenland
in
20
or
andrew
woodhouse
,
drowned
in
the
same
seas
in
1777
or
john
paxton
,
drowned
off
cape
farewell
a
year
later
or
old
john
rawlings
,
whose
grandfather
sailed
with
me
,
drowned
in
the
gulf
of
finland
in
50
.
do
ye
think
that
all
these
men
will
have
to
make
a
rush
to
whitby
when
the
trumpet
sounds
?
i
have
me
antherums
aboot
it
!
i
tell
ye
that
when
they
got
here
they
d
be
jommlin
an
jostlin
one
another
that
way
that
it
ud
be
like
a
fight
up
on
the
ice
in
the
old
days
,
when
we
d
be
at
one
another
from
daylight
to
dark
,
an
tryin
to
tie
up
our
cuts
by
the
light
of
the
aurora
borealis
.
this
was
evidently
local
pleasantry
,
for
the
old
man
cackled
over
it
,
and
his
cronies
joined
in
with
gusto
.
but
,
i
said
,
surely
you
are
not
quite
correct
,
for
you
start
on
the
assumption
that
all
the
poor
people
,
or
their
spirits
,
will
have
to
take
their
tombstones
with
them
on
the
day
of
judgment
.
do
you
think
that
will
be
really
necessary
?
well
,
what
else
be
they
tombstones
for
?
answer
me
that
,
miss
!
to
please
their
relatives
,
i
suppose
.
to
please
their
relatives
,
you
suppose
!
this
he
said
with
intense
scorn
.
how
will
it
pleasure
their
relatives
to
know
that
lies
is
wrote
over
them
,
and
that
everybody
in
the
place
knows
that
they
be
lies
?
he
pointed
to
a
stone
at
our
feet
which
had
been
laid
down
as
a
slab
,
on
which
the
seat
was
rested
,
close
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
.
read
the
lies
on
that
thruff
stean
,
he
said
.
the
letters
were
upside
down
to
me
from
where
i
sat
,
but
lucy
was
more
opposite
to
them
,
so
she
leant
over
and
read
sacred
to
the
memory
of
george
canon
,
who
died
,
in
the
hope
of
a
glorious
resurrection
,
on
july
,
29
,
1873
,
falling
from
the
rocks
at
kettleness
.
this
tomb
was
erected
by
his
sorrowing
mother
to
her
dearly
beloved
son
.
he
was
the
only
son
of
his
mother
,
and
she
was
a
widow
.
really
,
mr
.
swales
,
i
don
t
see
anything
very
funny
in
that
!
she
spoke
her
comment
very
gravely
and
somewhat
severely
.
ye
don
t
see
aught
funny
!
ha
!
ha
!
but
that
s
because
ye
don
t
gawm
the
sorrowin
mother
was
a
hell
cat
that
hated
him
because
he
was
acrewk
d
a
regular
lamiter
he
was
an
he
hated
her
so
that
he
committed
suicide
in
order
that
she
mightn
t
get
an
insurance
she
put
on
his
life
.
he
blew
nigh
the
top
of
his
head
off
with
an
old
musket
that
they
had
for
scarin
the
crows
with
.
twarn
t
for
crows
then
,
for
it
brought
the
clegs
and
the
dowps
to
him
.
that
s
the
way
he
fell
off
the
rocks
.
and
,
as
to
hopes
of
a
glorious
resurrection
,
i
ve
often
heard
him
say
masel
that
he
hoped
he
d
go
to
hell
,
for
his
mother
was
so
pious
that
she
d
be
sure
to
go
to
heaven
,
an
he
didn
t
want
to
addle
where
she
was
.
now
isn
t
that
stean
at
any
rate
he
hammered
it
with
his
stick
as
he
spoke
a
pack
of
lies
?
and
won
t
it
make
gabriel
keckle
when
geordie
comes
pantin
up
the
grees
with
the
tombstean
balanced
on
his
hump
,
and
asks
it
to
be
took
as
evidence
!
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
,
but
lucy
turned
the
conversation
as
she
said
,
rising
up
oh
,
why
did
you
tell
us
of
this
?
it
is
my
favourite
seat
,
and
i
cannot
leave
it
and
now
i
find
i
must
go
on
sitting
over
the
grave
of
a
suicide
.
that
won
t
harm
ye
,
my
pretty
an
it
may
make
poor
geordie
gladsome
to
have
so
trim
a
lass
sittin
on
his
lap
.
that
won
t
hurt
ye
.
why
,
i
ve
sat
here
off
an
on
for
nigh
twenty
years
past
,
an
it
hasn
t
done
me
no
harm
.
don
t
ye
fash
about
them
as
lies
under
ye
,
or
that
doesn
lie
there
either
!
it
ll
be
time
for
ye
to
be
getting
scart
when
ye
see
the
tombsteans
all
run
away
with
,
and
the
place
as
bare
as
a
stubble
field
.
there
s
the
clock
,
an
i
must
gang
.
my
service
to
ye
,
ladies
!
and
off
he
hobbled
.
lucy
and
i
sat
awhile
,
and
it
was
all
so
beautiful
before
us
that
we
took
hands
as
we
sat
and
she
told
me
all
over
again
about
arthur
and
their
coming
marriage
.
that
made
me
just
a
little
heart
sick
,
for
i
haven
t
heard
from
jonathan
for
a
whole
month
.
the
same
day
.
i
came
up
here
alone
,
for
i
am
very
sad
.
there
was
no
letter
for
me
.
i
hope
there
cannot
be
anything
the
matter
with
jonathan
.
the
clock
has
just
struck
nine
.
i
see
the
lights
scattered
all
over
the
town
,
sometimes
in
rows
where
the
streets
are
,
and
sometimes
singly
they
run
right
up
the
esk
and
die
away
in
the
curve
of
the
valley
.
to
my
left
the
view
is
cut
off
by
a
black
line
of
roof
of
the
old
house
next
the
abbey
.
the
sheep
and
lambs
are
bleating
in
the
fields
away
behind
me
,
and
there
is
a
clatter
of
a
donkey
s
hoofs
up
the
paved
road
below
.
the
band
on
the
pier
is
playing
a
harsh
waltz
in
good
time
,
and
further
along
the
quay
there
is
a
salvation
army
meeting
in
a
back
street
.
neither
of
the
bands
hears
the
other
,
but
up
here
i
hear
and
see
them
both
.
i
wonder
where
jonathan
is
and
if
he
is
thinking
of
me
!
i
wish
he
were
here
.

seward
s
diary
.
5
june
.
the
case
of
renfield
grows
more
interesting
the
more
i
get
to
understand
the
man
.
he
has
certain
qualities
very
largely
developed
selfishness
,
secrecy
,
and
purpose
.
i
wish
i
could
get
at
what
is
the
object
of
the
latter
.
he
seems
to
have
some
settled
scheme
of
his
own
,
but
what
it
is
i
do
not
yet
know
.
his
redeeming
quality
is
a
love
of
animals
,
though
,
indeed
,
he
has
such
curious
turns
in
it
that
i
sometimes
imagine
he
is
only
abnormally
cruel
.
his
pets
are
of
odd
sorts
.
just
now
his
hobby
is
catching
flies
.
he
has
at
present
such
a
quantity
that
i
have
had
myself
to
expostulate
.
to
my
astonishment
,
he
did
not
break
out
into
a
fury
,
as
i
expected
,
but
took
the
matter
in
simple
seriousness
.
he
thought
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
may
i
have
three
days
?
i
shall
clear
them
away
.
of
course
,
i
said
that
would
do
.
i
must
watch
him
.
18
june
.
he
has
turned
his
mind
now
to
spiders
,
and
has
got
several
very
big
fellows
in
a
box
.
he
keeps
feeding
them
with
his
flies
,
and
the
number
of
the
latter
is
becoming
sensibly
diminished
,
although
he
has
used
half
his
food
in
attracting
more
flies
from
outside
to
his
room
.
1
july
.
his
spiders
are
now
becoming
as
great
a
nuisance
as
his
flies
,
and
to
day
i
told
him
that
he
must
get
rid
of
them
.
he
looked
very
sad
at
this
,
so
i
said
that
he
must
clear
out
some
of
them
,
at
all
events
.
he
cheerfully
acquiesced
in
this
,
and
i
gave
him
the
same
time
as
before
for
reduction
.
he
disgusted
me
much
while
with
him
,
for
when
a
horrid
blow
fly
,
bloated
with
some
carrion
food
,
buzzed
into
the
room
,
he
caught
it
,
held
it
exultantly
for
a
few
moments
between
his
finger
and
thumb
,
and
,
before
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
,
put
it
in
his
mouth
and
ate
it
.
i
scolded
him
for
it
,
but
he
argued
quietly
that
it
was
very
good
and
very
wholesome
that
it
was
life
,
strong
life
,
and
gave
life
to
him
.
this
gave
me
an
idea
,
or
the
rudiment
of
one
.
i
must
watch
how
he
gets
rid
of
his
spiders
.
he
has
evidently
some
deep
problem
in
his
mind
,
for
he
keeps
a
little
note
book
in
which
he
is
always
jotting
down
something
.
whole
pages
of
it
are
filled
with
masses
of
figures
,
generally
single
numbers
added
up
in
batches
,
and
then
the
totals
added
in
batches
again
,
as
though
he
were
focussing
some
account
,
as
the
auditors
put
it
.
8
july
.
there
is
a
method
in
his
madness
,
and
the
rudimentary
idea
in
my
mind
is
growing
.
it
will
be
a
whole
idea
soon
,
and
then
,
oh
,
unconscious
cerebration
!
you
will
have
to
give
the
wall
to
your
conscious
brother
.
i
kept
away
from
my
friend
for
a
few
days
,
so
that
i
might
notice
if
there
were
any
change
.
things
remain
as
they
were
except
that
he
has
parted
with
some
of
his
pets
and
got
a
new
one
.
he
has
managed
to
get
a
sparrow
,
and
has
already
partially
tamed
it
.
his
means
of
taming
is
simple
,
for
already
the
spiders
have
diminished
.
those
that
do
remain
,
however
,
are
well
fed
,
for
he
still
brings
in
the
flies
by
tempting
them
with
his
food
.
19
july
.
we
are
progressing
.
my
friend
has
now
a
whole
colony
of
sparrows
,
and
his
flies
and
spiders
are
almost
obliterated
.
when
i
came
in
he
ran
to
me
and
said
he
wanted
to
ask
me
a
great
favour
a
very
,
very
great
favour
and
as
he
spoke
he
fawned
on
me
like
a
dog
.
i
asked
him
what
it
was
,
and
he
said
,
with
a
sort
of
rapture
in
his
voice
and
bearing
a
kitten
,
a
nice
little
,
sleek
playful
kitten
,
that
i
can
play
with
,
and
teach
,
and
feed
and
feed
and
feed
!
i
was
not
unprepared
for
this
request
,
for
i
had
noticed
how
his
pets
went
on
increasing
in
size
and
vivacity
,
but
i
did
not
care
that
his
pretty
family
of
tame
sparrows
should
be
wiped
out
in
the
same
manner
as
the
flies
and
the
spiders
so
i
said
i
would
see
about
it
,
and
asked
him
if
he
would
not
rather
have
a
cat
than
a
kitten
.
his
eagerness
betrayed
him
as
he
answered
oh
,
yes
,
i
would
like
a
cat
!
i
only
asked
for
a
kitten
lest
you
should
refuse
me
a
cat
.
no
one
would
refuse
me
a
kitten
,
would
they
?
i
shook
my
head
,
and
said
that
at
present
i
feared
it
would
not
be
possible
,
but
that
i
would
see
about
it
.
his
face
fell
,
and
i
could
see
a
warning
of
danger
in
it
,
for
there
was
a
sudden
fierce
,
sidelong
look
which
meant
killing
.
the
man
is
an
undeveloped
homicidal
maniac
.
i
shall
test
him
with
his
present
craving
and
see
how
it
will
work
out
then
i
shall
know
more
.
10
p
.
m
.
i
have
visited
him
again
and
found
him
sitting
in
a
corner
brooding
.
when
i
came
in
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
me
and
implored
me
to
let
him
have
a
cat
that
his
salvation
depended
upon
it
.
i
was
firm
,
however
,
and
told
him
that
he
could
not
have
it
,
whereupon
he
went
without
a
word
,
and
sat
down
,
gnawing
his
fingers
,
in
the
corner
where
i
had
found
him
.
i
shall
see
him
in
the
morning
early
.
20
july
.
visited
renfield
very
early
,
before
the
attendant
went
his
rounds
.
found
him
up
and
humming
a
tune
.
he
was
spreading
out
his
sugar
,
which
he
had
saved
,
in
the
window
,
and
was
manifestly
beginning
his
fly
catching
again
and
beginning
it
cheerfully
and
with
a
good
grace
.
i
looked
around
for
his
birds
,
and
not
seeing
them
,
asked
him
where
they
were
.
he
replied
,
without
turning
round
,
that
they
had
all
flown
away
.
there
were
a
few
feathers
about
the
room
and
on
his
pillow
a
drop
of
blood
.
i
said
nothing
,
but
went
and
told
the
keeper
to
report
to
me
if
there
were
anything
odd
about
him
during
the
day
.
11
a
.
m
.
the
attendant
has
just
been
to
me
to
say
that
renfield
has
been
very
sick
and
has
disgorged
a
whole
lot
of
feathers
.
my
belief
is
,
doctor
,
he
said
,
that
he
has
eaten
his
birds
,
and
that
he
just
took
and
ate
them
raw
!
11
p
.
m
.
i
gave
renfield
a
strong
opiate
to
night
,
enough
to
make
even
him
sleep
,
and
took
away
his
pocket
book
to
look
at
it
.
the
thought
that
has
been
buzzing
about
my
brain
lately
is
complete
,
and
the
theory
proved
.
my
homicidal
maniac
is
of
a
peculiar
kind
.
i
shall
have
to
invent
a
new
classification
for
him
,
and
call
him
a
zo
phagous
life
eating
maniac
what
he
desires
is
to
absorb
as
many
lives
as
he
can
,
and
he
has
laid
himself
out
to
achieve
it
in
a
cumulative
way
.
he
gave
many
flies
to
one
spider
and
many
spiders
to
one
bird
,
and
then
wanted
a
cat
to
eat
the
many
birds
.
what
would
have
been
his
later
steps
?
it
would
almost
be
worth
while
to
complete
the
experiment
.
it
might
be
done
if
there
were
only
a
sufficient
cause
.
men
sneered
at
vivisection
,
and
yet
look
at
its
results
to
day
!
why
not
advance
science
in
its
most
difficult
and
vital
aspect
the
knowledge
of
the
brain
?
had
i
even
the
secret
of
one
such
mind
did
i
hold
the
key
to
the
fancy
of
even
one
lunatic
i
might
advance
my
own
branch
of
science
to
a
pitch
compared
with
which
burdon
sanderson
s
physiology
or
ferrier
s
brain
knowledge
would
be
as
nothing
.
if
only
there
were
a
sufficient
cause
!
i
must
not
think
too
much
of
this
,
or
i
may
be
tempted
a
good
cause
might
turn
the
scale
with
me
,
for
may
not
i
too
be
of
an
exceptional
brain
,
congenitally
?
how
well
the
man
reasoned
lunatics
always
do
within
their
own
scope
.
i
wonder
at
how
many
lives
he
values
a
man
,
or
if
at
only
one
.
he
has
closed
the
account
most
accurately
,
and
to
day
begun
a
new
record
.
how
many
of
us
begin
a
new
record
with
each
day
of
our
lives
?
to
me
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
my
whole
life
ended
with
my
new
hope
,
and
that
truly
i
began
a
new
record
.
so
it
will
be
until
the
great
recorder
sums
me
up
and
closes
my
ledger
account
with
a
balance
to
profit
or
loss
.
oh
,
lucy
,
lucy
,
i
cannot
be
angry
with
you
,
nor
can
i
be
angry
with
my
friend
whose
happiness
is
yours
but
i
must
only
wait
on
hopeless
and
work
.
work
!
work
!
if
i
only
could
have
as
strong
a
cause
as
my
poor
mad
friend
there
a
good
,
unselfish
cause
to
make
me
work
that
would
be
indeed
happiness
.

murray
s
journal
.
26
july
.
i
am
anxious
,
and
it
soothes
me
to
express
myself
here
it
is
like
whispering
to
one
s
self
and
listening
at
the
same
time
.
and
there
is
also
something
about
the
shorthand
symbols
that
makes
it
different
from
writing
.
i
am
unhappy
about
lucy
and
about
jonathan
.
i
had
not
heard
from
jonathan
for
some
time
,
and
was
very
concerned
but
yesterday
dear
mr
.
hawkins
,
who
is
always
so
kind
,
sent
me
a
letter
from
him
.
i
had
written
asking
him
if
he
had
heard
,
and
he
said
the
enclosed
had
just
been
received
.
it
is
only
a
line
dated
from
castle
dracula
,
and
says
that
he
is
just
starting
for
home
.
that
is
not
like
jonathan
i
do
not
understand
it
,
and
it
makes
me
uneasy
.
then
,
too
,
lucy
,
although
she
is
so
well
,
has
lately
taken
to
her
old
habit
of
walking
in
her
sleep
.
her
mother
has
spoken
to
me
about
it
,
and
we
have
decided
that
i
am
to
lock
the
door
of
our
room
every
night
.
mrs
.
westenra
has
got
an
idea
that
sleep
walkers
always
go
out
on
roofs
of
houses
and
along
the
edges
of
cliffs
and
then
get
suddenly
wakened
and
fall
over
with
a
despairing
cry
that
echoes
all
over
the
place
.
poor
dear
,
she
is
naturally
anxious
about
lucy
,
and
she
tells
me
that
her
husband
,
lucy
s
father
,
had
the
same
habit
that
he
would
get
up
in
the
night
and
dress
himself
and
go
out
,
if
he
were
not
stopped
.
lucy
is
to
be
married
in
the
autumn
,
and
she
is
already
planning
out
her
dresses
and
how
her
house
is
to
be
arranged
.
i
sympathise
with
her
,
for
i
do
the
same
,
only
jonathan
and
i
will
start
in
life
in
a
very
simple
way
,
and
shall
have
to
try
to
make
both
ends
meet
.

,
and
i
think
dear
lucy
is
counting
the
moments
till
he
comes
.
she
wants
to
take
him
up
to
the
seat
on
the
churchyard
cliff
and
show
him
the
beauty
of
whitby
.
i
daresay
it
is
the
waiting
which
disturbs
her
she
will
be
all
right
when
he
arrives
.
27
july
.
no
news
from
jonathan
.
i
am
getting
quite
uneasy
about
him
,
though
why
i
should
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
wish
that
he
would
write
,
if
it
were
only
a
single
line
.
lucy
walks
more
than
ever
,
and
each
night
i
am
awakened
by
her
moving
about
the
room
.
fortunately
,
the
weather
is
so
hot
that
she
cannot
get
cold
but
still
the
anxiety
and
the
perpetually
being
wakened
is
beginning
to
tell
on
me
,
and
i
am
getting
nervous
and
wakeful
myself
.
thank
god
,
lucy
s
health
keeps
up
.
mr
.
holmwood
has
been
suddenly
called
to
ring
to
see
his
father
,
who
has
been
taken
seriously
ill
.
lucy
frets
at
the
postponement
of
seeing
him
,
but
it
does
not
touch
her
looks
she
is
a
trifle
stouter
,
and
her
cheeks
are
a
lovely
rose
pink
.
she
has
lost
that
an
mic
look
which
she
had
.
i
pray
it
will
all
last
.
3
august
.
another
week
gone
,
and
no
news
from
jonathan
,
not
even
to
mr
.
hawkins
,
from
whom
i
have
heard
.
oh
,
i
do
hope
he
is
not
ill
.
he
surely
would
have
written
.
i
look
at
that
last
letter
of
his
,
but
somehow
it
does
not
satisfy
me
.
it
does
not
read
like
him
,
and
yet
it
is
his
writing
.
there
is
no
mistake
of
that
.
lucy
has
not
walked
much
in
her
sleep
the
last
week
,
but
there
is
an
odd
concentration
about
her
which
i
do
not
understand
even
in
her
sleep
she
seems
to
be
watching
me
.
she
tries
the
door
,
and
finding
it
locked
,
goes
about
the
room
searching
for
the
key
.
6
august
.
another
three
days
,
and
no
news
.
this
suspense
is
getting
dreadful
.
if
i
only
knew
where
to
write
to
or
where
to
go
to
,
i
should
feel
easier
but
no
one
has
heard
a
word
of
jonathan
since
that
last
letter
.
i
must
only
pray
to
god
for
patience
.
lucy
is
more
excitable
than
ever
,
but
is
otherwise
well
.
last
night
was
very
threatening
,
and
the
fishermen
say
that
we
are
in
for
a
storm
.
i
must
try
to
watch
it
and
learn
the
weather
signs
.
to
day
is
a
grey
day
,
and
the
sun
as
i
write
is
hidden
in
thick
clouds
,
high
over
kettleness
.
everything
is
grey
except
the
green
grass
,
which
seems
like
emerald
amongst
it
grey
earthy
rock
grey
clouds
,
tinged
with
the
sunburst
at
the
far
edge
,
hang
over
the
grey
sea
,
into
which
the
sand
points
stretch
like
grey
fingers
.
the
sea
is
tumbling
in
over
the
shallows
and
the
sandy
flats
with
a
roar
,
muffled
in
the
sea
mists
drifting
inland
.
the
horizon
is
lost
in
a
grey
mist
.
all
is
vastness
the
clouds
are
piled
up
like
giant
rocks
,
and
there
is
a
brool
over
the
sea
that
sounds
like
some
presage
of
doom
.
dark
figures
are
on
the
beach
here
and
there
,
sometimes
half
shrouded
in
the
mist
,
and
seem
men
like
trees
walking
.
the
fishing
boats
are
racing
for
home
,
and
rise
and
dip
in
the
ground
swell
as
they
sweep
into
the
harbour
,
bending
to
the
scuppers
.
here
comes
old
mr
.
swales
.
he
is
making
straight
for
me
,
and
i
can
see
,
by
the
way
he
lifts
his
hat
,
that
he
wants
to
talk
....
i
have
been
quite
touched
by
the
change
in
the
poor
old
man
.
when
he
sat
down
beside
me
,
he
said
in
a
very
gentle
way
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
,
miss
.
i
could
see
he
was
not
at
ease
,
so
i
took
his
poor
old
wrinkled
hand
in
mine
and
asked
him
to
speak
fully
so
he
said
,
leaving
his
hand
in
mine
i
m
afraid
,
my
deary
,
that
i
must
have
shocked
you
by
all
the
wicked
things
i
ve
been
sayin
about
the
dead
,
and
such
like
,
for
weeks
past
but
i
didn
t
mean
them
,
and
i
want
ye
to
remember
that
when
i
m
gone
.
we
aud
folks
that
be
daffled
,
and
with
one
foot
abaft
the
krok
hooal
,
don
t
altogether
like
to
think
of
it
,
and
we
don
t
want
to
feel
scart
of
it
an
that
s
why
i
ve
took
to
makin
light
of
it
,
so
that
i
d
cheer
up
my
own
heart
a
bit
.
but
,
lord
love
ye
,
miss
,
i
ain
t
afraid
of
dyin
,
not
a
bit
only
i
don
t
want
to
die
if
i
can
help
it
.
my
time
must
be
nigh
at
hand
now
,
for
i
be
aud
,
and
a
hundred
years
is
too
much
for
any
man
to
expect
and
i
m
so
nigh
it
that
the
aud
man
is
already
whettin
his
scythe
.
ye
see
,
i
can
t
get
out
o
the
habit
of
caffin
about
it
all
at
once
the
chafts
will
wag
as
they
be
used
to
.
some
day
soon
the
angel
of
death
will
sound
his
trumpet
for
me
.
but
don
t
ye
dooal
an
greet
,
my
deary
!
for
he
saw
that
i
was
crying
if
he
should
come
this
very
night
i
d
not
refuse
to
answer
his
call
.
for
life
be
,
after
all
,
only
a
waitin
for
somethin
else
than
what
we
re
doin
and
death
be
all
that
we
can
rightly
depend
on
.
but
i
m
content
,
for
it
s
comin
to
me
,
my
deary
,
and
comin
quick
.
it
may
be
comin
while
we
be
lookin
and
wonderin
.
maybe
it
s
in
that
wind
out
over
the
sea
that
s
bringin
with
it
loss
and
wreck
,
and
sore
distress
,
and
sad
hearts
.
look
!
look
!
he
cried
suddenly
.
there
s
something
in
that
wind
and
in
the
hoast
beyont
that
sounds
,
and
looks
,
and
tastes
,
and
smells
like
death
.
it
s
in
the
air
i
feel
it
comin
.
lord
,
make
me
answer
cheerful
when
my
call
comes
!
he
held
up
his
arms
devoutly
,
and
raised
his
hat
.
his
mouth
moved
as
though
he
were
praying
.
after
a
few
minutes
silence
,
he
got
up
,
shook
hands
with
me
,
and
blessed
me
,
and
said
good
bye
,
and
hobbled
off
.
it
all
touched
me
,
and
upset
me
very
much
.
i
was
glad
when
the
coastguard
came
along
,
with
his
spy
glass
under
his
arm
.
he
stopped
to
talk
with
me
,
as
he
always
does
,
but
all
the
time
kept
looking
at
a
strange
ship
.
i
can
t
make
her
out
,
he
said
she
s
a
russian
,
by
the
look
of
her
but
she
s
knocking
about
in
the
queerest
way
.
she
doesn
t
know
her
mind
a
bit
she
seems
to
see
the
storm
coming
,
but
can
t
decide
whether
to
run
up
north
in
the
open
,
or
to
put
in
here
.
look
there
again
!
she
is
steered
mighty
strangely
,
for
she
doesn
t
mind
the
hand
on
the
wheel
changes
about
with
every
puff
of
wind
.
we
ll
hear
more
of
her
before
this
time
to
morrow
.

cutting
from

august
pasted

journal

from
a
correspondent
.
whitby
.
one
of
the
greatest
and
suddenest
storms
on
record
has
just
been
experienced
here
,
with
results
both
strange
and
unique
.
the
weather
had
been
somewhat
sultry
,
but
not
to
any
degree
uncommon
in
the
month
of
august
.
saturday
evening
was
as
fine
as
was
ever
known
,
and
the
great
body
of
holiday
makers
laid
out
yesterday
for
visits
to
mulgrave
woods
,
robin
hood
s
bay
,
rig
mill
,
runswick
,
staithes
,
and
the
various
trips
in
the
neighbourhood
of
whitby
.
the
steamers
emma
and
scarborough
made
trips
up
and
down
the
coast
,
and
there
was
an
unusual
amount
of
tripping
both
to
and
from
whitby
.
the
day
was
unusually
fine
till
the
afternoon
,
when
some
of
the
gossips
who
frequent
the
east
cliff
churchyard
,
and
from
that
commanding
eminence
watch
the
wide
sweep
of
sea
visible
to
the
north
and
east
,
called
attention
to
a
sudden
show
of
mares
tails
high
in
the
sky
to
the
north
west
.
the
wind
was
then
blowing
from
the
south
west
in
the
mild
degree
which
in
barometrical
language
is
ranked
no
.
2
light
breeze
.
the
coastguard
on
duty
at
once
made
report
,
and
one
old
fisherman
,
who
for
more
than
half
a
century
has
kept
watch
on
weather
signs
from
the
east
cliff
,
foretold
in
an
emphatic
manner
the
coming
of
a
sudden
storm
.
the
approach
of
sunset
was
so
very
beautiful
,
so
grand
in
its
masses
of
splendidly
coloured
clouds
,
that
there
was
quite
an
assemblage
on
the
walk
along
the
cliff
in
the
old
churchyard
to
enjoy
the
beauty
.
before
the
sun
dipped
below
the
black
mass
of
kettleness
,
standing
boldly
athwart
the
western
sky
,
its
downward
way
was
marked
by
myriad
clouds
of
every
sunset
colour
flame
,
purple
,
pink
,
green
,
violet
,
and
all
the
tints
of
gold
with
here
and
there
masses
not
large
,
but
of
seemingly
absolute
blackness
,
in
all
sorts
of
shapes
,
as
well
outlined
as
colossal
silhouettes
.
the
experience
was
not
lost
on
the
painters
,
and
doubtless
some
of
the
sketches
of
the
prelude
to
the
great
storm
will
grace
the
r
.
a
.
and
r
.
i
.
walls
in
may
next
.
more
than
one
captain
made
up
his
mind
then
and
there
that
his
cobble
or
his
mule
,
as
they
term
the
different
classes
of
boats
,
would
remain
in
the
harbour
till
the
storm
had
passed
.
the
wind
fell
away
entirely
during
the
evening
,
and
at
midnight
there
was
a
dead
calm
,
a
sultry
heat
,
and
that
prevailing
intensity
which
,
on
the
approach
of
thunder
,
affects
persons
of
a
sensitive
nature
.
there
were
but
few
lights
in
sight
at
sea
,
for
even
the
coasting
steamers
,
which
usually
hug
the
shore
so
closely
,
kept
well
to
seaward
,
and
but
few
fishing
boats
were
in
sight
.
the
only
sail
noticeable
was
a
foreign
schooner
with
all
sails
set
,
which
was
seemingly
going
westwards
.
the
foolhardiness
or
ignorance
of
her
officers
was
a
prolific
theme
for
comment
whilst
she
remained
in
sight
,
and
efforts
were
made
to
signal
her
to
reduce
sail
in
face
of
her
danger
.
before
the
night
shut
down
she
was
seen
with
sails
idly
flapping
as
she
gently
rolled
on
the
undulating
swell
of
the
sea
,
as
idle
as
a
painted
ship
upon
a
painted
ocean
.
shortly
before
ten
o
clock
the
stillness
of
the
air
grew
quite
oppressive
,
and
the
silence
was
so
marked
that
the
bleating
of
a
sheep
inland
or
the
barking
of
a
dog
in
the
town
was
distinctly
heard
,
and
the
band
on
the
pier
,
with
its
lively
french
air
,
was
like
a
discord
in
the
great
harmony
of
nature
s
silence
.
a
little
after
midnight
came
a
strange
sound
from
over
the
sea
,
and
high
overhead
the
air
began
to
carry
a
strange
,
faint
,
hollow
booming
.
then
without
warning
the
tempest
broke
.
with
a
rapidity
which
,
at
the
time
,
seemed
incredible
,
and
even
afterwards
is
impossible
to
realize
,
the
whole
aspect
of
nature
at
once
became
convulsed
.
the
waves
rose
in
growing
fury
,
each
overtopping
its
fellow
,
till
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
lately
glassy
sea
was
like
a
roaring
and
devouring
monster
.
white
crested
waves
beat
madly
on
the
level
sands
and
rushed
up
the
shelving
cliffs
others
broke
over
the
piers
,
and
with
their
spume
swept
the
lanthorns
of
the
lighthouses
which
rise
from
the
end
of
either
pier
of
whitby
harbour
.
the
wind
roared
like
thunder
,
and
blew
with
such
force
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
even
strong
men
kept
their
feet
,
or
clung
with
grim
clasp
to
the
iron
stanchions
.
it
was
found
necessary
to
clear
the
entire
piers
from
the
mass
of
onlookers
,
or
else
the
fatalities
of
the
night
would
have
been
increased
manifold
.
to
add
to
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
the
time
,
masses
of
sea
fog
came
drifting
inland
white
,
wet
clouds
,
which
swept
by
in
ghostly
fashion
,
so
dank
and
damp
and
cold
that
it
needed
but
little
effort
of
imagination
to
think
that
the
spirits
of
those
lost
at
sea
were
touching
their
living
brethren
with
the
clammy
hands
of
death
,
and
many
a
one
shuddered
as
the
wreaths
of
sea
mist
swept
by
.
at
times
the
mist
cleared
,
and
the
sea
for
some
distance
could
be
seen
in
the
glare
of
the
lightning
,
which
now
came
thick
and
fast
,
followed
by
such
sudden
peals
of
thunder
that
the
whole
sky
overhead
seemed
trembling
under
the
shock
of
the
footsteps
of
the
storm
.
some
of
the
scenes
thus
revealed
were
of
immeasurable
grandeur
and
of
absorbing
interest
the
sea
,
running
mountains
high
,
threw
skywards
with
each
wave
mighty
masses
of
white
foam
,
which
the
tempest
seemed
to
snatch
at
and
whirl
away
into
space
here
and
there
a
fishing
boat
,
with
a
rag
of
sail
,
running
madly
for
shelter
before
the
blast
now
and
again
the
white
wings
of
a
storm
tossed
sea
bird
.
on
the
summit
of
the
east
cliff
the
new
searchlight
was
ready
for
experiment
,
but
had
not
yet
been
tried
.
the
officers
in
charge
of
it
got
it
into
working
order
,
and
in
the
pauses
of
the
inrushing
mist
swept
with
it
the
surface
of
the
sea
.
once
or
twice
its
service
was
most
effective
,
as
when
a
fishing
boat
,
with
gunwale
under
water
,
rushed
into
the
harbour
,
able
,
by
the
guidance
of
the
sheltering
light
,
to
avoid
the
danger
of
dashing
against
the
piers
.
as
each
boat
achieved
the
safety
of
the
port
there
was
a
shout
of
joy
from
the
mass
of
people
on
shore
,
a
shout
which
for
a
moment
seemed
to
cleave
the
gale
and
was
then
swept
away
in
its
rush
.
before
long
the
searchlight
discovered
some
distance
away
a
schooner
with
all
sails
set
,
apparently
the
same
vessel
which
had
been
noticed
earlier
in
the
evening
.
the
wind
had
by
this
time
backed
to
the
east
,
and
there
was
a
shudder
amongst
the
watchers
on
the
cliff
as
they
realized
the
terrible
danger
in
which
she
now
was
.
between
her
and
the
port
lay
the
great
flat
reef
on
which
so
many
good
ships
have
from
time
to
time
suffered
,
and
,
with
the
wind
blowing
from
its
present
quarter
,
it
would
be
quite
impossible
that
she
should
fetch
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
.
it
was
now
nearly
the
hour
of
high
tide
,
but
the
waves
were
so
great
that
in
their
troughs
the
shallows
of
the
shore
were
almost
visible
,
and
the
schooner
,
with
all
sails
set
,
was
rushing
with
such
speed
that
,
in
the
words
of
one
old
salt
,
she
must
fetch
up
somewhere
,
if
it
was
only
in
hell
.
then
came
another
rush
of
sea
fog
,
greater
than
any
hitherto
a
mass
of
dank
mist
,
which
seemed
to
close
on
all
things
like
a
grey
pall
,
and
left
available
to
men
only
the
organ
of
hearing
,
for
the
roar
of
the
tempest
,
and
the
crash
of
the
thunder
,
and
the
booming
of
the
mighty
billows
came
through
the
damp
oblivion
even
louder
than
before
.
the
rays
of
the
searchlight
were
kept
fixed
on
the
harbour
mouth
across
the
east
pier
,
where
the
shock
was
expected
,
and
men
waited
breathless
.
the
wind
suddenly
shifted
to
the
north
east
,
and
the
remnant
of
the
sea
fog
melted
in
the
blast
and
then
,
mirabile
dictu
,
between
the
piers
,
leaping
from
wave
to
wave
as
it
rushed
at
headlong
speed
,
swept
the
strange
schooner
before
the
blast
,
with
all
sail
set
,
and
gained
the
safety
of
the
harbour
.
the
searchlight
followed
her
,
and
a
shudder
ran
through
all
who
saw
her
,
for
lashed
to
the
helm
was
a
corpse
,
with
drooping
head
,
which
swung
horribly
to
and
fro
at
each
motion
of
the
ship
.
no
other
form
could
be
seen
on
deck
at
all
.
a
great
awe
came
on
all
as
they
realised
that
the
ship
,
as
if
by
a
miracle
,
had
found
the
harbour
,
unsteered
save
by
the
hand
of
a
dead
man
!
however
,
all
took
place
more
quickly
than
it
takes
to
write
these
words
.
the
schooner
paused
not
,
but
rushing
across
the
harbour
,
pitched
herself
on
that
accumulation
of
sand
and
gravel
washed
by
many
tides
and
many
storms
into
the
south
east
corner
of
the
pier
jutting
under
the
east
cliff
,
known
locally
as
tate
hill
pier
.
there
was
of
course
a
considerable
concussion
as
the
vessel
drove
up
on
the
sand
heap
.
every
spar
,
rope
,
and
stay
was
strained
,
and
some
of
the
top
hammer
came
crashing
down
.
but
,
strangest
of
all
,
the
very
instant
the
shore
was
touched
,
an
immense
dog
sprang
up
on
deck
from
below
,
as
if
shot
up
by
the
concussion
,
and
running
forward
,
jumped
from
the
bow
on
the
sand
.
making
straight
for
the
steep
cliff
,
where
the
churchyard
hangs
over
the
laneway
to
the
east
pier
so
steeply
that
some
of
the
flat
tombstones
thruff
steans
or
through
stones
,
as
they
call
them
in
the
whitby
vernacular
actually
project
over
where
the
sustaining
cliff
has
fallen
away
,
it
disappeared
in
the
darkness
,
which
seemed
intensified
just
beyond
the
focus
of
the
searchlight
.
it
so
happened
that
there
was
no
one
at
the
moment
on
tate
hill
pier
,
as
all
those
whose
houses
are
in
close
proximity
were
either
in
bed
or
were
out
on
the
heights
above
.
thus
the
coastguard
on
duty
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
harbour
,
who
at
once
ran
down
to
the
little
pier
,
was
the
first
to
climb
on
board
.
the
men
working
the
searchlight
,
after
scouring
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
without
seeing
anything
,
then
turned
the
light
on
the
derelict
and
kept
it
there
.
the
coastguard
ran
aft
,
and
when
he
came
beside
the
wheel
,
bent
over
to
examine
it
,
and
recoiled
at
once
as
though
under
some
sudden
emotion
.
this
seemed
to
pique
general
curiosity
,
and
quite
a
number
of
people
began
to
run
.
it
is
a
good
way
round
from
the
west
cliff
by
the
drawbridge
to
tate
hill
pier
,
but
your
correspondent
is
a
fairly
good
runner
,
and
came
well
ahead
of
the
crowd
.
when
i
arrived
,
however
,
i
found
already
assembled
on
the
pier
a
crowd
,
whom
the
coastguard
and
police
refused
to
allow
to
come
on
board
.
by
the
courtesy
of
the
chief
boatman
,
i
was
,
as
your
correspondent
,
permitted
to
climb
on
deck
,
and
was
one
of
a
small
group
who
saw
the
dead
seaman
whilst
actually
lashed
to
the
wheel
.
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
coastguard
was
surprised
,
or
even
awed
,
for
not
often
can
such
a
sight
have
been
seen
.
the
man
was
simply
fastened
by
his
hands
,
tied
one
over
the
other
,
to
a
spoke
of
the
wheel
.
between
the
inner
hand
and
the
wood
was
a
crucifix
,
the
set
of
beads
on
which
it
was
fastened
being
around
both
wrists
and
wheel
,
and
all
kept
fast
by
the
binding
cords
.
the
poor
fellow
may
have
been
seated
at
one
time
,
but
the
flapping
and
buffeting
of
the
sails
had
worked
through
the
rudder
of
the
wheel
and
dragged
him
to
and
fro
,
so
that
the
cords
with
which
he
was
tied
had
cut
the
flesh
to
the
bone
.
accurate
note
was
made
of
the
state
of
things
,
and
a
doctor
surgeon
j
.
m
.
caffyn
,
of
33
,
east
elliot
place
who
came
immediately
after
me
,
declared
,
after
making
examination
,
that
the
man
must
have
been
dead
for
quite
two
days
.
in
his
pocket
was
a
bottle
,
carefully
corked
,
empty
save
for
a
little
roll
of
paper
,
which
proved
to
be
the
addendum
to
the
log
.
the
coastguard
said
the
man
must
have
tied
up
his
own
hands
,
fastening
the
knots
with
his
teeth
.
the
fact
that
a
coastguard
was
the
first
on
board
may
save
some
complications
,
later
on
,
in
the
admiralty
court
for
coastguards
cannot
claim
the
salvage
which
is
the
right
of
the
first
civilian
entering
on
a
derelict
.
already
,
however
,
the
legal
tongues
are
wagging
,
and
one
young
law
student
is
loudly
asserting
that
the
rights
of
the
owner
are
already
completely
sacrificed
,
his
property
being
held
in
contravention
of
the
statutes
of
mortmain
,
since
the
tiller
,
as
emblemship
,
if
not
proof
,
of
delegated
possession
,
is
held
in
a
dead
hand
.
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
dead
steersman
has
been
reverently
removed
from
the
place
where
he
held
his
honourable
watch
and
ward
till
death
a
steadfastness
as
noble
as
that
of
the
young
casabianca
and
placed
in
the
mortuary
to
await
inquest
.
already
the
sudden
storm
is
passing
,
and
its
fierceness
is
abating
crowds
are
scattering
homeward
,
and
the
sky
is
beginning
to
redden
over
the
yorkshire
wolds
.
i
shall
send
,
in
time
for
your
next
issue
,
further
details
of
the
derelict
ship
which
found
her
way
so
miraculously
into
harbour
in
the
storm
.
whitby
9
august
.
the
sequel
to
the
strange
arrival
of
the
derelict
in
the
storm
last
night
is
almost
more
startling
than
the
thing
itself
.
it
turns
out
that
the
schooner
is
a
russian
from
varna
,
and
is
called
the
demeter
.
she
is
almost
entirely
in
ballast
of
silver
sand
,
with
only
a
small
amount
of
cargo
a
number
of
great
wooden
boxes
filled
with
mould
.
this
cargo
was
consigned
to
a
whitby
solicitor
,
mr
.
s
.
f
.
billington
,
of
7
,
the
crescent
,
who
this
morning
went
aboard
and
formally
took
possession
of
the
goods
consigned
to
him
.
the
russian
consul
,
too
,
acting
for
the
charter
party
,
took
formal
possession
of
the
ship
,
and
paid
all
harbour
dues
,
etc
.
nothing
is
talked
about
here
to
day
except
the
strange
coincidence
the
officials
of
the
board
of
trade
have
been
most
exacting
in
seeing
that
every
compliance
has
been
made
with
existing
regulations
.
as
the
matter
is
to
be
a
nine
days
wonder
,
they
are
evidently
determined
that
there
shall
be
no
cause
of
after
complaint
.
a
good
deal
of
interest
was
abroad
concerning
the
dog
which
landed
when
the
ship
struck
,
and
more
than
a
few
of
the
members
of
the
s
.
p
.
c
.
a
.,
which
is
very
strong
in
whitby
,
have
tried
to
befriend
the
animal
.
to
the
general
disappointment
,
however
,
it
was
not
to
be
found
it
seems
to
have
disappeared
entirely
from
the
town
.
it
may
be
that
it
was
frightened
and
made
its
way
on
to
the
moors
,
where
it
is
still
hiding
in
terror
.
there
are
some
who
look
with
dread
on
such
a
possibility
,
lest
later
on
it
should
in
itself
become
a
danger
,
for
it
is
evidently
a
fierce
brute
.
early
this
morning
a
large
dog
,
a
half
bred
mastiff
belonging
to
a
coal
merchant
close
to
tate
hill
pier
,
was
found
dead
in
the
roadway
opposite
to
its
master
s
yard
.
it
had
been
fighting
,
and
manifestly
had
had
a
savage
opponent
,
for
its
throat
was
torn
away
,
and
its
belly
was
slit
open
as
if
with
a
savage
claw
.
later
.
by
the
kindness
of
the
board
of
trade
inspector
,
i
have
been
permitted
to
look
over
the
log
book
of
the
demeter
,
which
was
in
order
up
to
within
three
days
,
but
contained
nothing
of
special
interest
except
as
to
facts
of
missing
men
.
the
greatest
interest
,
however
,
is
with
regard
to
the
paper
found
in
the
bottle
,
which
was
to
day
produced
at
the
inquest
and
a
more
strange
narrative
than
the
two
between
them
unfold
it
has
not
been
my
lot
to
come
across
.
as
there
is
no
motive
for
concealment
,
i
am
permitted
to
use
them
,
and
accordingly
send
you
a
rescript
,
simply
omitting
technical
details
of
seamanship
and
supercargo
.
it
almost
seems
as
though
the
captain
had
been
seized
with
some
kind
of
mania
before
he
had
got
well
into
blue
water
,
and
that
this
had
developed
persistently
throughout
the
voyage
.

my
statement

be

on

yesterday
,
one
of
the
men
,
olgaren
,
came
to
my
cabin
,
and
in
an
awestruck
way
confided
to
me
that
he
thought
there
was
a
strange
man
aboard
the
ship
.
he
said
that
in
his
watch
he
had
been
sheltering
behind
the
deck
house
,
as
there
was
a
rain
storm
,
when
he
saw
a
tall
,
thin
man
,
who
was
not
like
any
of
the
crew
,
come
up
the
companion
way
,
and
go
along
the
deck
forward
,
and
disappear
.
he
followed
cautiously
,
but
when
he
got
to
bows
found
no
one
,
and
the
hatchways
were
all
closed
.
he
was
in
a
panic
of
superstitious
fear
,
and
i
am
afraid
the
panic
may
spread
.
to
allay
it
,
i
shall
to
day
search
entire
ship
carefully
from
stem
to
stern
.
later
in
the
day
i
got
together
the
whole
crew
,
and
told
them
,
as
they
evidently
thought
there
was
some
one
in
the
ship
,
we
would
search
from

to

3
august
.
at
midnight
i
went
to
relieve
the
man
at
the
wheel
,
and
when
i
got
to
it
found
no
one
there
.
the
wind
was
steady
,
and
as
we
ran
before
it
there
was
no
yawing
.
i
dared
not
leave
it
,
so
shouted
for
the
mate
.
after
a
few
seconds
he
rushed
up
on
deck
in
his
flannels
.
he
looked
wild
eyed
and
haggard
,
and
i
greatly
fear
his
reason
has
given
way
.
he
came
close
to
me
and
whispered
hoarsely
,
with
his
mouth
to
my
ear
,
as
though
fearing
the
very
air
might
hear
it
is
here
i
know
it
,
now
.
on
the
watch
last
night
i
saw
it
,
like
a
man
,
tall
and
thin
,
and
ghastly
pale
.
it
was
in
the
bows
,
and
looking
out
.
i
crept
behind
it
,
and
gave
it
my
knife
but
the
knife
went
through
it
,
empty
as
the
air
.
and
as
he
spoke
he
took
his
knife
and
drove
it
savagely
into
space
.
then
he
went
on
but
it
is
here
,
and
i
ll
find
it
.
it
is
in
the
hold
,
perhaps
in
one
of
those
boxes
.
i
ll
unscrew
them
one
by
one
and
see
.
you
work
the
helm
.
and
,
with
a
warning
look
and
his
finger
on
his
lip
,
he
went
below
.
there
was
springing
up
a
choppy
wind
,
and
i
could
not
leave
the
helm
.
i
saw
him
come
out
on
deck
again
with
a
tool
chest
and
a
lantern
,
and
go
down
the
forward
hatchway
.
he
is
mad
,
stark
,
raving
mad
,
and
it
s
no
use
my
trying
to
stop
him
.
he
can
t
hurt
those
big
boxes
they
are
invoiced
as
clay
,
and
to
pull
them
about
is
as
harmless
a
thing
as
he
can
do
.
so
here
i
stay
,
and
mind
the
helm
,
and
write
these
notes
.
i
can
only
trust
in
god
and
wait
till
the
fog
clears
.
then
,
if
i
can
t
steer
to
any
harbour
with
the
wind
that
is
,
i
shall
cut
down
sails
and
lie
by
,
and
signal
for
help
....
it
is
nearly
all
over
now
.
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
hope
that
the
mate
would
come
out
calmer
for
i
heard
him
knocking
away
at
something
in
the
hold
,
and
work
is
good
for
him
there
came
up
the
hatchway
a
sudden
,
startled
scream
,
which
made
my
blood
run
cold
,
and
up
on
the
deck
he
came
as
if
shot
from
a
gun
a
raging
madman
,
with
his
eyes
rolling
and
his
face
convulsed
with
fear
.
save
me
!
save
me
!
he
cried
,
and
then
looked
round
on
the
blanket
of
fog
.
his
horror
turned
to
despair
,
and
in
a
steady
voice
he
said
you
had
better
come
too
,
captain
,
before
it
is
too
late
.
he
is
there
.
i
know
the
secret
now
.
the
sea
will
save
me
from
him
,
and
it
is
all
that
is
left
!
before
i
could
say
a
word
,
or
move
forward
to
seize
him
,
he
sprang
on
the
bulwark
and
deliberately
threw
himself
into
the
sea
.
i
suppose
i
know
the
secret
too
,
now
.
it
was
this
madman
who
had
got
rid
of
the
men
one
by
one
,
and
now
he
has
followed
them
himself
.
god
help
me
!
how
am
i
to
account
for
all
these
horrors
when
i
get
to
port
?
when
i
get
to
port
!
will
that
ever
be
?

still

,
which
the
sunrise
cannot
pierce
.
i
know
there
is
sunrise
because
i
am
a
sailor
,
why
else
i
know
not
.
i
dared
not
go
below
,
i
dared
not
leave
the
helm
so
here
all
night
i
stayed
,
and
in
the
dimness
of
the
night
i
saw
it
him
!
god
forgive
me
,
but
the
mate
was
right
to
jump
overboard
.
it
was
better
to
die
like
a
man
to
die
like
a
sailor
in
blue
water
no
man
can
object
.
but
i
am
captain
,
and
i
must
not
leave
my
ship
.
but
i
shall
baffle
this
fiend
or
monster
,
for
i
shall
tie
my
hands
to
the
wheel
when
my
strength
begins
to
fail
,
and
along
with
them
i
shall
tie
that
which
he
it
!
dare
not
touch
and
then
,
come
good
wind
or
foul
,
i
shall
save
my
soul
,
and
my
honour
as
a
captain
.
i
am
growing
weaker
,
and
the
night
is
coming
on
.
if
he
can
look
me
in
the
face
again
,
i
may
not
have
time
to
act
....
if
we
are
wrecked
,
mayhap
this
bottle
may
be
found
,
and
those
who
find
it
may
understand
if
not
,
...
well
,
then
all
men
shall
know
that
i
have
been
true
to
my
trust
.
god
and
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
saints
help
a
poor
ignorant
soul
trying
to
do
his
duty
....
of
course
the
verdict
was
an
open
one
.
there
is
no
evidence
to
adduce
and
whether
or
not
the
man
himself
committed
the
murders
there
is
now
none
to
say
.
the
folk
here
hold
almost
universally
that
the
captain
is
simply
a
hero
,
and
he
is
to
be
given
a
public
funeral
.
already
it
is
arranged
that
his
body
is
to
be
taken
with
a
train
of
boats
up
the
esk
for
a
piece
and
then
brought
back
to
tate
hill
pier
and
up
the
abbey
steps
for
he
is
to
be
buried
in
the
churchyard
on
the
cliff
.
the
owners
of
more
than
a
hundred
boats
have
already
given
in
their
names
as
wishing
to
follow
him
to
the
grave
.
no
trace
has
ever
been
found
of
the
great
dog
at
which
there
is
much
mourning
,
for
,
with
public
opinion
in
its
present
state
,
he
would
,
i
believe
,
be
adopted
by
the
town
.
to
morrow
will
see
the
funeral
and
so
will
end
this
one
more
mystery
of
the
sea

8
august
.
lucy
was
very
restless
all
night
,
and
i
,
too
,
could
not
sleep
.
the
storm
was
fearful
,
and
as
it
boomed
loudly
among
the
chimney
pots
,
it
made
me
shudder
.
when
a
sharp
puff
came
it
seemed
to
be
like
a
distant
gun
.
strangely
enough
,
lucy
did
not
wake
but
she
got
up
twice
and
dressed
herself
.
fortunately
,
each
time
i
awoke
in
time
and
managed
to
undress
her
without
waking
her
,
and
got
her
back
to
bed
.
it
is
a
very
strange
thing
,
this
sleep
walking
,
for
as
soon
as
her
will
is
thwarted
in
any
physical
way
,
her
intention
,
if
there
be
any
,
disappears
,
and
she
yields
herself
almost
exactly
to
the
routine
of
her
life
.
early
in
the
morning
we
both
got
up
and
went
down
to
the
harbour
to
see
if
anything
had
happened
in
the
night
.
there
were
very
few
people
about
,
and
though
the
sun
was
bright
,
and
the
air
clear
and
fresh
,
the
big
,
grim
looking
waves
,
that
seemed
dark
themselves
because
the
foam
that
topped
them
was
like
snow
,
forced
themselves
in
through
the
narrow
mouth
of
the
harbour
like
a
bullying
man
going
through
a
crowd
.
somehow
i
felt
glad
that
jonathan
was
not
on
the
sea
last
night
,
but
on
land
.
but
,
oh
,
is
he
on
land
or
sea
?
where
is
he
,
and
how
?
i
am
getting
fearfully
anxious
about
him
.
if
i
only
knew
what
to
do
,
and
could
do
anything
!
10
august
.
the
funeral
of
the
poor
sea
captain
to
day
was
most
touching
.
every
boat
in
the
harbour
seemed
to
be
there
,
and
the
coffin
was
carried
by
captains
all
the
way
from
tate
hill
pier
up
to
the
churchyard
.
lucy
came
with
me
,
and
we
went
early
to
our
old
seat
,
whilst
the
cort
ge
of
boats
went
up
the
river
to
the
viaduct
and
came
down
again
.
we
had
a
lovely
view
,
and
saw
the
procession
nearly
all
the
way
.
the
poor
fellow
was
laid
to
rest
quite
near
our
seat
so
that
we
stood
on
it
when
the
time
came
and
saw
everything
.
poor
lucy
seemed
much
upset
.
she
was
restless
and
uneasy
all
the
time
,
and
i
cannot
but
think
that
her
dreaming
at
night
is
telling
on
her
.
she
is
quite
odd
in
one
thing
she
will
not
admit
to
me
that
there
is
any
cause
for
restlessness
or
if
there
be
,
she
does
not
understand
it
herself
.
there
is
an
additional
cause
in
that
poor
old
mr
.
swales
was
found
dead
this
morning
on
our
seat
,
his
neck
being
broken
.
he
had
evidently
,
as
the
doctor
said
,
fallen
back
in
the
seat
in
some
sort
of
fright
,
for
there
was
a
look
of
fear
and
horror
on
his
face
that
the
men
said
made
them
shudder
.
poor
dear
old
man
!
perhaps
he
had
seen
death
with
his
dying
eyes
!
lucy
is
so
sweet
and
sensitive
that
she
feels
influences
more
acutely
than
other
people
do
.
just
now
she
was
quite
upset
by
a
little
thing
which
i
did
not
much
heed
,
though
i
am
myself
very
fond
of
animals
.
one
of
the
men
who
came
up
here
often
to
look
for
the
boats
was
followed
by
his
dog
.
the
dog
is
always
with
him
.
they
are
both
quiet
persons
,
and
i
never
saw
the
man
angry
,
nor
heard
the
dog
bark
.
during
the
service
the
dog
would
not
come
to
its
master
,
who
was
on
the
seat
with
us
,
but
kept
a
few
yards
off
,
barking
and
howling
.
its
master
spoke
to
it
gently
,
and
then
harshly
,
and
then
angrily
but
it
would
neither
come
nor
cease
to
make
a
noise
.
it
was
in
a
sort
of
fury
,
with
its
eyes
savage
,
and
all
its
hairs
bristling
out
like
a
cat
s
tail
when
puss
is
on
the
war
path
.
finally
the
man
,
too
,
got
angry
,
and
jumped
down
and
kicked
the
dog
,
and
then
took
it
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
half
dragged
and
half
threw
it
on
the
tombstone
on
which
the
seat
is
fixed
.
the
moment
it
touched
the
stone
the
poor
thing
became
quiet
and
fell
all
into
a
tremble
.
it
did
not
try
to
get
away
,
but
crouched
down
,
quivering
and
cowering
,
and
was
in
such
a
pitiable
state
of
terror
that
i
tried
,
though
without
effect
,
to
comfort
it
.
lucy
was
full
of
pity
,
too
,
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
touch
the
dog
,
but
looked
at
it
in
an
agonised
sort
of
way
.
i
greatly
fear
that
she
is
of
too
super
sensitive
a
nature
to
go
through
the
world
without
trouble
.
she
will
be
dreaming
of
this
to
night
,
i
am
sure
.
the
whole
agglomeration
of
things
the
ship
steered
into
port
by
a
dead
man
his
attitude
,
tied
to
the
wheel
with
a
crucifix
and
beads
the
touching
funeral
the
dog
,
now
furious
and
now
in
terror
will
all
afford
material
for
her
dreams
.
i
think
it
will
be
best
for
her
to
go
to
bed
tired
out
physically
,
so
i
shall
take
her
for
a
long
walk
by
the
cliffs
to
robin
hood
s
bay
and
back
.
she
ought
not
to
have
much
inclination
for
sleep
walking
then

oh
,
but
i
am
tired
!
if
it
were
not
that
i
had
made
my
diary
a
duty
i
should
not
open
it
to
night
.
we
had
a
lovely
walk
.
lucy
,
after
a
while
,
was
in
gay
spirits
,
owing
,
i
think
,
to
some
dear
cows
who
came
nosing
towards
us
in
a
field
close
to
the
lighthouse
,
and
frightened
the
wits
out
of
us
.
i
believe
we
forgot
everything
except
,
of
course
,
personal
fear
,
and
it
seemed
to
wipe
the
slate
clean
and
give
us
a
fresh
start
.
we
had
a
capital
severe
tea
at
robin
hood
s
bay
in
a
sweet
little
old
fashioned
inn
,
with
a
bow
window
right
over
the
seaweed
covered
rocks
of
the
strand
.
i
believe
we
should
have
shocked
the
new
woman
with
our
appetites
.
men
are
more
tolerant
,
bless
them
!
then
we
walked
home
with
some
,
or
rather
many
,
stoppages
to
rest
,
and
with
our
hearts
full
of
a
constant
dread
of
wild
bulls
.
lucy
was
really
tired
,
and
we
intended
to
creep
off
to
bed
as
soon
as
we
could
.
the
young
curate
came
in
,
however
,
and
mrs
.
westenra
asked
him
to
stay
for
supper
.
lucy
and
i
had
both
a
fight
for
it
with
the
dusty
miller
i
know
it
was
a
hard
fight
on
my
part
,
and
i
am
quite
heroic
.
i
think
that
some
day
the
bishops
must
get
together
and
see
about
breeding
up
a
new
class
of
curates
,
who
don
t
take
supper
,
no
matter
how
they
may
be
pressed
to
,
and
who
will
know
when
girls
are
tired
.
lucy
is
asleep
and
breathing
softly
.
she
has
more
colour
in
her
cheeks
than
usual
,
and
looks
,
oh
,
so
sweet
.
if
mr
.
holmwood
fell
in
love
with
her
seeing
her
only
in
the
drawing
room
,
i
wonder
what
he
would
say
if
he
saw
her
now
.
some
of
the
new
women
writers
will
some
day
start
an
idea
that
men
and
women
should
be
allowed
to
see
each
other
asleep
before
proposing
or
accepting
.
but
i
suppose
the
new
woman
won
t
condescend
in
future
to
accept
she
will
do
the
proposing
herself
.
and
a
nice
job
she
will
make
of
it
,
too
!
there
s
some
consolation
in
that
.
i
am
so
happy
to
night
,
because
dear
lucy
seems
better
.
i
really
believe
she
has
turned
the
corner
,
and
that
we
are
over
her
troubles
with
dreaming
.
i
should
be
quite
happy
if
i
only
knew
if
jonathan
....
god
bless
and
keep
him

3
a
.
m
.
diary
again
.
no
sleep
now
,
so
i
may
as
well
write
.
i
am
too
agitated
to
sleep
.
we
have
had
such
an
adventure
,
such
an
agonising
experience
.
i
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
i
had
closed
my
diary
....
suddenly
i
became
broad
awake
,
and
sat
up
,
with
a
horrible
sense
of
fear
upon
me
,
and
of
some
feeling
of
emptiness
around
me
.
the
room
was
dark
,
so
i
could
not
see
lucy
s
bed
i
stole
across
and
felt
for
her
.
the
bed
was
empty
.
i
lit
a
match
and
found
that
she
was
not
in
the
room
.
the
door
was
shut
,
but
not
locked
,
as
i
had
left
it
.
i
feared
to
wake
her
mother
,
who
has
been
more
than
usually
ill
lately
,
so
threw
on
some
clothes
and
got
ready
to
look
for
her
.
as
i
was
leaving
the
room
it
struck
me
that
the
clothes
she
wore
might
give
me
some
clue
to
her
dreaming
intention
.
dressing
gown
would
mean
house
dress
,
outside
.
dressing
gown
and
dress
were
both
in
their
places
.
thank
god
,
i
said
to
myself
,
she
cannot
be
far
,
as
she
is
only
in
her
nightdress
.
i
ran
downstairs
and
looked
in
the
sitting
room
.
not
there
!
then
i
looked
in
all
the
other
open
rooms
of
the
house
,
with
an
ever
growing
fear
chilling
my
heart
.
finally
i
came
to
the
hall
door
and
found
it
open
.
it
was
not
wide
open
,
but
the
catch
of
the
lock
had
not
caught
.
the
people
of
the
house
are
careful
to
lock
the
door
every
night
,
so
i
feared
that
lucy
must
have
gone
out
as
she
was
.
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
what
might
happen
a
vague
,
overmastering
fear
obscured
all
details
.
i
took
a
big
,
heavy
shawl
and
ran
out
.
the
clock
was
striking
one
as
i
was
in
the
crescent
,
and
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
.
i
ran
along
the
north
terrace
,
but
could
see
no
sign
of
the
white
figure
which
i
expected
.
at
the
edge
of
the
west
cliff
above
the
pier
i
looked
across
the
harbour
to
the
east
cliff
,
in
the
hope
or
fear
i
don
t
know
which
of
seeing
lucy
in
our
favourite
seat
.
there
was
a
bright
full
moon
,
with
heavy
black
,
driving
clouds
,
which
threw
the
whole
scene
into
a
fleeting
diorama
of
light
and
shade
as
they
sailed
across
.
for
a
moment
or
two
i
could
see
nothing
,
as
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
obscured
st
.
mary
s
church
and
all
around
it
.
then
as
the
cloud
passed
i
could
see
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
coming
into
view
and
as
the
edge
of
a
narrow
band
of
light
as
sharp
as
a
sword
cut
moved
along
,
the
church
and
the
churchyard
became
gradually
visible
.
whatever
my
expectation
was
,
it
was
not
disappointed
,
for
there
,
on
our
favourite
seat
,
the
silver
light
of
the
moon
struck
a
half
reclining
figure
,
snowy
white
.
the
coming
of
the
cloud
was
too
quick
for
me
to
see
much
,
for
shadow
shut
down
on
light
almost
immediately
but
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
something
dark
stood
behind
the
seat
where
the
white
figure
shone
,
and
bent
over
it
.
what
it
was
,
whether
man
or
beast
,
i
could
not
tell
i
did
not
wait
to
catch
another
glance
,
but
flew
down
the
steep
steps
to
the
pier
and
along
by
the
fish
market
to
the
bridge
,
which
was
the
only
way
to
reach
the
east
cliff
.
the
town
seemed
as
dead
,
for
not
a
soul
did
i
see
i
rejoiced
that
it
was
so
,
for
i
wanted
no
witness
of
poor
lucy
s
condition
.
the
time
and
distance
seemed
endless
,
and
my
knees
trembled
and
my
breath
came
laboured
as
i
toiled
up
the
endless
steps
to
the
abbey
.
i
must
have
gone
fast
,
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
my
feet
were
weighted
with
lead
,
and
as
though
every
joint
in
my
body
were
rusty
.
when
i
got
almost
to
the
top
i
could
see
the
seat
and
the
white
figure
,
for
i
was
now
close
enough
to
distinguish
it
even
through
the
spells
of
shadow
.
there
was
undoubtedly
something
,
long
and
black
,
bending
over
the
half
reclining
white
figure
.
i
called
in
fright
,
lucy
!
lucy
!
and
something
raised
a
head
,
and
from
where
i
was
i
could
see
a
white
face
and
red
,
gleaming
eyes
.
lucy
did
not
answer
,
and
i
ran
on
to
the
entrance
of
the
churchyard
.
as
i
entered
,
the
church
was
between
me
and
the
seat
,
and
for
a
minute
or
so
i
lost
sight
of
her
.
when
i
came
in
view
again
the
cloud
had
passed
,
and
the
moonlight
struck
so
brilliantly
that
i
could
see
lucy
half
reclining
with
her
head
lying
over
the
back
of
the
seat
.
she
was
quite
alone
,
and
there
was
not
a
sign
of
any
living
thing
about
.
when
i
bent
over
her
i
could
see
that
she
was
still
asleep
.
her
lips
were
parted
,
and
she
was
breathing
not
softly
as
usual
with
her
,
but
in
long
,
heavy
gasps
,
as
though
striving
to
get
her
lungs
full
at
every
breath
.
as
i
came
close
,
she
put
up
her
hand
in
her
sleep
and
pulled
the
collar
of
her
nightdress
close
around
her
throat
.
whilst
she
did
so
there
came
a
little
shudder
through
her
,
as
though
she
felt
the
cold
.
i
flung
the
warm
shawl
over
her
,
and
drew
the
edges
tight
round
her
neck
,
for
i
dreaded
lest
she
should
get
some
deadly
chill
from
the
night
air
,
unclad
as
she
was
.
i
feared
to
wake
her
all
at
once
,
so
,
in
order
to
have
my
hands
free
that
i
might
help
her
,
i
fastened
the
shawl
at
her
throat
with
a
big
safety
pin
but
i
must
have
been
clumsy
in
my
anxiety
and
pinched
or
pricked
her
with
it
,
for
by
and
by
,
when
her
breathing
became
quieter
,
she
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
again
and
moaned
.
when
i
had
her
carefully
wrapped
up
i
put
my
shoes
on
her
feet
and
then
began
very
gently
to
wake
her
.
at
first
she
did
not
respond
but
gradually
she
became
more
and
more
uneasy
in
her
sleep
,
moaning
and
sighing
occasionally
.
at
last
,
as
time
was
passing
fast
,
and
,
for
many
other
reasons
,
i
wished
to
get
her
home
at
once
,
i
shook
her
more
forcibly
,
till
finally
she
opened
her
eyes
and
awoke
.
she
did
not
seem
surprised
to
see
me
,
as
,
of
course
,
she
did
not
realise
all
at
once
where
she
was
.
lucy
always
wakes
prettily
,
and
even
at
such
a
time
,
when
her
body
must
have
been
chilled
with
cold
,
and
her
mind
somewhat
appalled
at
waking
unclad
in
a
churchyard
at
night
,
she
did
not
lose
her
grace
.
she
trembled
a
little
,
and
clung
to
me
when
i
told
her
to
come
at
once
with
me
home
she
rose
without
a
word
,
with
the
obedience
of
a
child
.
as
we
passed
along
,
the
gravel
hurt
my
feet
,
and
lucy
noticed
me
wince
.
she
stopped
and
wanted
to
insist
upon
my
taking
my
shoes
but
i
would
not
.
however
,
when
we
got
to
the
pathway
outside
the
churchyard
,
where
there
was
a
puddle
of
water
,
remaining
from
the
storm
,
i
daubed
my
feet
with
mud
,
using
each
foot
in
turn
on
the
other
,
so
that
as
we
went
home
,
no
one
,
in
case
we
should
meet
any
one
,
should
notice
my
bare
feet
.
fortune
favoured
us
,
and
we
got
home
without
meeting
a
soul
.
once
we
saw
a
man
,
who
seemed
not
quite
sober
,
passing
along
a
street
in
front
of
us
but
we
hid
in
a
door
till
he
had
disappeared
up
an
opening
such
as
there
are
here
,
steep
little
closes
,
or
wynds
,
as
they
call
them
in
scotland
.
my
heart
beat
so
loud
all
the
time
that
sometimes
i
thought
i
should
faint
.
i
was
filled
with
anxiety
about
lucy
,
not
only
for
her
health
,
lest
she
should
suffer
from
the
exposure
,
but
for
her
reputation
in
case
the
story
should
get
wind
.
when
we
got
in
,
and
had
washed
our
feet
,
and
had
said
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
together
,
i
tucked
her
into
bed
.
before
falling
asleep
she
asked
even
implored
me
not
to
say
a
word
to
any
one
,
even
her
mother
,
about
her
sleep
walking
adventure
.
i
hesitated
at
first
to
promise
but
on
thinking
of
the
state
of
her
mother
s
health
,
and
how
the
knowledge
of
such
a
thing
would
fret
her
,
and
thinking
,
too
,
of
how
such
a
story
might
become
distorted
nay
,
infallibly
would
in
case
it
should
leak
out
,
i
thought
it
wiser
to
do
so
.
i
hope
i
did
right
.
i
have
locked
the
door
,
and
the
key
is
tied
to
my
wrist
,
so
perhaps
i
shall
not
be
again
disturbed
.
lucy
is
sleeping
soundly
the
reflex
of
the
dawn
is
high
and
far
over
the
sea
....
same
day
,
noon
.
all
goes
well
.
lucy
slept
till
i
woke
her
and
seemed
not
to
have
even
changed
her
side
.
the
adventure
of
the
night
does
not
seem
to
have
harmed
her
on
the
contrary
,
it
has
benefited
her
,
for
she
looks
better
this
morning
than
she
has
done
for
weeks
.
i
was
sorry
to
notice
that
my
clumsiness
with
the
safety
pin
hurt
her
.
indeed
,
it
might
have
been
serious
,
for
the
skin
of
her
throat
was
pierced
.
i
must
have
pinched
up
a
piece
of
loose
skin
and
have
transfixed
it
,
for
there
are
two
little
red
points
like
pin
pricks
,
and
on
the
band
of
her
nightdress
was
a
drop
of
blood
.
when
i
apologised
and
was
concerned
about
it
,
she
laughed
and
petted
me
,
and
said
she
did
not
even
feel
it
.
fortunately
it
cannot
leave
a
scar
,
as
it
is
so
tiny
.
same
day
,
night
.
we
passed
a
happy
day
.
the
air
was
clear
,
and
the
sun
bright
,
and
there
was
a
cool
breeze
.
we
took
our
lunch
to
mulgrave
woods
,
mrs
.
westenra
driving
by
the
road
and
lucy
and
i
walking
by
the
cliff
path
and
joining
her
at
the
gate
.
i
felt
a
little
sad
myself
,
for
i
could
not
but
feel
how
absolutely
happy
it
would
have
been
had
jonathan
been
with
me
.
but
there
!
i
must
only
be
patient
.
in
the
evening
we
strolled
in
the
casino
terrace
,
and
heard
some
good
music
by
spohr
and
mackenzie
,
and
went
to
bed
early
.
lucy
seems
more
restful
than
she
has
been
for
some
time
,
and
fell
asleep
at
once
.
i
shall
lock
the
door
and
secure
the
key
the
same
as
before
,
though
i
do
not
expect
any
trouble
to
night
.
12
august
.
my
expectations
were
wrong
,
for
twice
during
the
night
i
was
wakened
by
lucy
trying
to
get
out
.
she
seemed
,
even
in
her
sleep
,
to
be
a
little
impatient
at
finding
the
door
shut
,
and
went
back
to
bed
under
a
sort
of
protest
.
i
woke
with
the
dawn
,
and
heard
the
birds
chirping
outside
of
the
window
.
lucy
woke
,
too
,
and
,
i
was
glad
to
see
,
was
even
better
than
on
the
previous
morning
.
all
her
old
gaiety
of
manner
seemed
to
have
come
back
,
and
she
came
and
snuggled
in
beside
me
and
told
me
all
about
arthur
.
i
told
her
how
anxious
i
was
about
jonathan
,
and
then
she
tried
to
comfort
me
.
well
,
she
succeeded
somewhat
,
for
,
though
sympathy
can
t
alter
facts
,
it
can
help
to
make
them
more
bearable
.
13
august
.
another
quiet
day
,
and
to
bed
with
the
key
on
my
wrist
as
before
.
again
i
awoke
in
the
night
,
and
found
lucy
sitting
up
in
bed
,
still
asleep
,
pointing
to
the
window
.
i
got
up
quietly
,
and
pulling
aside
the
blind
,
looked
out
.
it
was
brilliant
moonlight
,
and
the
soft
effect
of
the
light
over
the
sea
and
sky
merged
together
in
one
great
,
silent
mystery
was
beautiful
beyond
words
.
between
me
and
the
moonlight
flitted
a
great
bat
,
coming
and
going
in
great
whirling
circles
.
once
or
twice
it
came
quite
close
,
but
was
,
i
suppose
,
frightened
at
seeing
me
,
and
flitted
away
across
the
harbour
towards
the
abbey
.
when
i
came
back
from
the
window
lucy
had
lain
down
again
,
and
was
sleeping
peacefully
.
she
did
not
stir
again
all
night
.
14
august
.
on
the
east
cliff
,
reading
and
writing
all
day
.
lucy
seems
to
have
become
as
much
in
love
with
the
spot
as
i
am
,
and
it
is
hard
to
get
her
away
from
it
when
it
is
time
to
come
home
for
lunch
or
tea
or
dinner
.
this
afternoon
she
made
a
funny
remark
.
we
were
coming
home
for
dinner
,
and
had
come
to
the
top
of
the
steps
up
from
the
west
pier
and
stopped
to
look
at
the
view
,
as
we
generally
do
.
the
setting
sun
,
low
down
in
the
sky
,
was
just
dropping
behind
kettleness
the
red
light
was
thrown
over
on
the
east
cliff
and
the
old
abbey
,
and
seemed
to
bathe
everything
in
a
beautiful
rosy
glow
.
we
were
silent
for
a
while
,
and
suddenly
lucy
murmured
as
if
to
herself
his
red
eyes
again
!
they
are
just
the
same
.
it
was
such
an
odd
expression
,
coming
apropos
of
nothing
,
that
it
quite
startled
me
.
i
slewed
round
a
little
,
so
as
to
see
lucy
well
without
seeming
to
stare
at
her
,
and
saw
that
she
was
in
a
half
dreamy
state
,
with
an
odd
look
on
her
face
that
i
could
not
quite
make
out
so
i
said
nothing
,
but
followed
her
eyes
.
she
appeared
to
be
looking
over
at
our
own
seat
,
whereon
was
a
dark
figure
seated
alone
.
i
was
a
little
startled
myself
,
for
it
seemed
for
an
instant
as
if
the
stranger
had
great
eyes
like
burning
flames
but
a
second
look
dispelled
the
illusion
.
the
red
sunlight
was
shining
on
the
windows
of
st
.
mary
s
church
behind
our
seat
,
and
as
the
sun
dipped
there
was
just
sufficient
change
in
the
refraction
and
reflection
to
make
it
appear
as
if
the
light
moved
.
i
called
lucy
s
attention
to
the
peculiar
effect
,
and
she
became
herself
with
a
start
,
but
she
looked
sad
all
the
same
it
may
have
been
that
she
was
thinking
of
that
terrible
night
up
there
.
we
never
refer
to
it
so
i
said
nothing
,
and
we
went
home
to
dinner
.
lucy
had
a
headache
and
went
early
to
bed
.
i
saw
her
asleep
,
and
went
out
for
a
little
stroll
myself
i
walked
along
the
cliffs
to
the
westward
,
and
was
full
of
sweet
sadness
,
for
i
was
thinking
of
jonathan
.
when
coming
home
it
was
then
bright
moonlight
,
so
bright
that
,
though
the
front
of
our
part
of
the
crescent
was
in
shadow
,
everything
could
be
well
seen
i
threw
a
glance
up
at
our
window
,
and
saw
lucy
s
head
leaning
out
.
i
thought
that
perhaps
she
was
looking
out
for
me
,
so
i
opened
my
handkerchief
and
waved
it
.
she
did
not
notice
or
make
any
movement
whatever
.
just
then
,
the
moonlight
crept
round
an
angle
of
the
building
,
and
the
light
fell
on
the
window
.
there
distinctly
was
lucy
with
her
head
lying
up
against
the
side
of
the
window
sill
and
her
eyes
shut
.
she
was
fast
asleep
,
and
by
her
,
seated
on
the
window
sill
,
was
something
that
looked
like
a
good
sized
bird
.
i
was
afraid
she
might
get
a
chill
,
so
i
ran
upstairs
,
but
as
i
came
into
the
room
she
was
moving
back
to
her
bed
,
fast
asleep
,
and
breathing
heavily
she
was
holding
her
hand
to
her
throat
,
as
though
to
protect
it
from
cold
.
i
did
not
wake
her
,
but
tucked
her
up
warmly
i
have
taken
care
that
the
door
is
locked
and
the
window
securely
fastened
.
she
looks
so
sweet
as
she
sleeps
but
she
is
paler
than
is
her
wont
,
and
there
is
a
drawn
,
haggard
look
under
her
eyes
which
i
do
not
like
.
i
fear
she
is
fretting
about
something
.
i
wish
i
could
find
out
what
it
is
.
15
august
.
rose
later
than
usual
.
lucy
was
languid
and
tired
,
and
slept
on
after
we
had
been
called
.
we
had
a
happy
surprise
at
breakfast
.
arthur
s
father
is
better
,
and
wants
the
marriage
to
come
off
soon
.
lucy
is
full
of
quiet
joy
,
and
her
mother
is
glad
and
sorry
at
once
.
later
on
in
the
day
she
told
me
the
cause
.
she
is
grieved
to
lose
lucy
as
her
very
own
,
but
she
is
rejoiced
that
she
is
soon
to
have
some
one
to
protect
her
.
poor
dear
,
sweet
lady
!
she
confided
to
me
that
she
has
got
her
death
warrant
.
she
has
not
told
lucy
,
and
made
me
promise
secrecy
her
doctor
told
her
that
within
a
few
months
,
at
most
,
she
must
die
,
for
her
heart
is
weakening
.
at
any
time
,
even
now
,
a
sudden
shock
would
be
almost
sure
to
kill
her
.
ah
,
we
were
wise
to
keep
from
her
the
affair
of
the
dreadful
night
of
lucy
s
sleep
walking
.
17
august
.
no
diary
for
two
whole
days
.
i
have
not
had
the
heart
to
write
.
some
sort
of
shadowy
pall
seems
to
be
coming
over
our
happiness
.
no
news
from
jonathan
,
and
lucy
seems
to
be
growing
weaker
,
whilst
her
mother
s
hours
are
numbering
to
a
close
.
i
do
not
understand
lucy
s
fading
away
as
she
is
doing
.
she
eats
well
and
sleeps
well
,
and
enjoys
the
fresh
air
but
all
the
time
the
roses
in
her
cheeks
are
fading
,
and
she
gets
weaker
and
more
languid
day
by
day
at
night
i
hear
her
gasping
as
if
for
air
.
i
keep
the
key
of
our
door
always
fastened
to
my
wrist
at
night
,
but
she
gets
up
and
walks
about
the
room
,
and
sits
at
the
open
window
.
last
night
i
found
her
leaning
out
when
i
woke
up
,
and
when
i
tried
to
wake
her
i
could
not
she
was
in
a
faint
.
when
i
managed
to
restore
her
she
was
as
weak
as
water
,
and
cried
silently
between
long
,
painful
struggles
for
breath
.
when
i
asked
her
how
she
came
to
be
at
the
window
she
shook
her
head
and
turned
away
.
i
trust
her
feeling
ill
may
not
be
from
that
unlucky
prick
of
the
safety
pin
.
i
looked
at
her
throat
just
now
as
she
lay
asleep
,
and
the
tiny
wounds
seem
not
to
have
healed
.
they
are
still
open
,
and
,
if
anything
,
larger
than
before
,
and
the
edges
of
them
are
faintly
white
.
they
are
like
little
white
dots
with
red
centres
.
unless
they
heal
within
a
day
or
two
,
i
shall
insist
on
the
doctor
seeing
about
them

august

i
am
happy
to
day
,
and
write
sitting
on
the
seat
in
the
churchyard
.
lucy
is
ever
so
much
better
.
last
night
she
slept
well
all
night
,
and
did
not
disturb
me
once
.
the
roses
seem
coming
back
already
to
her
cheeks
,
though
she
is
still
sadly
pale
and
wan
looking
.
if
she
were
in
any
way
an
mic
i
could
understand
it
,
but
she
is
not
.
she
is
in
gay
spirits
and
full
of
life
and
cheerfulness
.
all
the
morbid
reticence
seems
to
have
passed
from
her
,
and
she
has
just
reminded
me
,
as
if
i
needed
any
reminding
,
of
that
night
,
and
that
it
was
here
,
on
this
very
seat
,
i
found
her
asleep
.
as
she
told
me
she
tapped
playfully
with
the
heel
of
her
boot
on
the
stone
slab
and
said
my
poor
little
feet
didn
t
make
much
noise
then
!
i
daresay
poor
old
mr
.
swales
would
have
told
me
that
it
was
because
i
didn
t
want
to
wake
up
geordie
.
as
she
was
in
such
a
communicative
humour
,
i
asked
her
if
she
had
dreamed
at
all
that
night
.
before
she
answered
,
that
sweet
,
puckered
look
came
into
her
forehead
,
which
arthur
i
call
him
arthur
from
her
habit
says
he
loves
and
,
indeed
,
i
don
t
wonder
that
he
does
.
then
she
went
on
in
a
half
dreaming
kind
of
way
,
as
if
trying
to
recall
it
to
herself
i
didn
t
quite
dream
but
it
all
seemed
to
be
real
.
i
only
wanted
to
be
here
in
this
spot
i
don
t
know
why
,
for
i
was
afraid
of
something
i
don
t
know
what
.
i
remember
,
though
i
suppose
i
was
asleep
,
passing
through
the
streets
and
over
the
bridge
.
a
fish
leaped
as
i
went
by
,
and
i
leaned
over
to
look
at
it
,
and
i
heard
a
lot
of
dogs
howling
the
whole
town
seemed
as
if
it
must
be
full
of
dogs
all
howling
at
once
as
i
went
up
the
steps
.
then
i
had
a
vague
memory
of
something
long
and
dark
with
red
eyes
,
just
as
we
saw
in
the
sunset
,
and
something
very
sweet
and
very
bitter
all
around
me
at
once
and
then
i
seemed
sinking
into
deep
green
water
,
and
there
was
a
singing
in
my
ears
,
as
i
have
heard
there
is
to
drowning
men
and
then
everything
seemed
passing
away
from
me
my
soul
seemed
to
go
out
from
my
body
and
float
about
the
air
.
i
seem
to
remember
that
once
the
west
lighthouse
was
right
under
me
,
and
then
there
was
a
sort
of
agonising
feeling
,
as
if
i
were
in
an
earthquake
,
and
i
came
back
and
found
you
shaking
my
body
.
i
saw
you
do
it
before
i
felt
you
.
then
she
began
to
laugh
.
it
seemed
a
little
uncanny
to
me
,
and
i
listened
to
her
breathlessly
.
i
did
not
quite
like
it
,
and
thought
it
better
not
to
keep
her
mind
on
the
subject
,
so
we
drifted
on
to
other
subjects
,
and
lucy
was
like
her
old
self
again
.
when
we
got
home
the
fresh
breeze
had
braced
her
up
,
and
her
pale
cheeks
were
really
more
rosy
.
her
mother
rejoiced
when
she
saw
her
,
and
we
all
spent
a
very
happy
evening
together
.

at
last
,
news
of
jonathan
.
the
dear
fellow
has
been
ill
that
is
why
he
did
not
write
.
i
am
not
afraid
to
think
it
or
say
it
,
now
that
i
know
.
mr
.
hawkins
sent
me
on
the
letter
,
and
wrote
himself
,

so
kindly
.
i
am
to
leave
in
the
morning
and
go
over
to
jonathan
,
and
to
help
to
nurse
him
if
necessary
,
and
to
bring
him
home
.
mr
.
hawkins
says
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
if
we
were
to
be
married
out
there
.
i
have
cried
over
the
good
sister
s
letter
till
i
can
feel
it
wet
against
my
bosom
,
where
it
lies
.
it
is
of
jonathan
,
and
must
be
next
my
heart
,
for
he
is
in
my
heart
.

dear
madam
,
i
write
by
desire
of
mr
.
jonathan
harker
,
who
is
himself
not
strong
enough
to
write
,
though
progressing
well
,
thanks
to

and
st
.
joseph
and
ste

mary
.
he
has
been
under
our
care
for
nearly
six
weeks
,
suffering
from
a
violent
brain
fever
.
he
wishes
me
to
convey
his
love
,
and
to
say
that
by
this
post
i
write
for
him
to
mr
.
peter
hawkins
,
exeter
,
to
say
,
with
his
dutiful
respects
,
that
he
is
sorry
for
his
delay
,
and
that
all
of
his
work
is
completed
.
he
will
require
some
few
weeks
rest
in
our
sanatorium
in
the
hills
,
but
will
then
return
.
he
wishes
me
to
say
that
he
has
not
sufficient
money
with
him
,
and
that
he
would
like
to
pay
for
his
staying
here
,
so
that
others
who
need
shall
not
be
wanting
for
help
.

and
all

s
.
my
patient
being
asleep
,
i
open
this
to
let
you
know
something
more
.
he
has
told
me
all
about
you
,
and
that
you
are
shortly
to
be
his
wife
.
all
blessings
to
you
both
!
he
has
had
some
fearful
shock
so
says
our
doctor
and
in
his
delirium
his
ravings
have
been
dreadful
of
wolves
and
poison
and
blood
of
ghosts
and
demons
and
i
fear
to
say
of
what
.
be
careful
with
him
always
that
there
may
be
nothing
to
excite
him
of
this
kind
for
a
long
time
to
come
the
traces
of
such
an
illness
as
his
do
not
lightly
die
away
.
we
should
have
written
long
ago
,
but
we
knew
nothing
of
his
friends
,
and
there
was
on
him
nothing
that
any
one
could
understand
.
he
came
in
the
train
from
klausenburg
,
and
the
guard
was
told
by
the
station
master
there
that
he
rushed
into
the
station
shouting
for
a
ticket
for
home
.
seeing
from
his
violent
demeanour
that
he
was
english
,
they
gave
him
a
ticket
for
the
furthest
station
on
the
way
thither
that
the
train
reached
.
be
assured
that
he
is
well
cared
for
.
he
has
won
all
hearts
by
his
sweetness
and
gentleness
.
he
is
truly
getting
on
well
,
and
i
have
no
doubt
will

strange
and
sudden
change
in
renfield
last
night
.
about
eight
o
clock
he
began
to
get
excited
and
sniff
about
as
a
dog
does
when
setting
.
the
attendant
was
struck
by
his
manner
,
and
knowing
my
interest
in
him
,
encouraged
him
to
talk
.
he
is
usually
respectful
to
the
attendant
and
at
times
servile
but
to
night
,
the
man
tells
me
,
he
was
quite
haughty
.
would
not
condescend
to
talk
with
him
at
all
.
all
he
would
say
was
i
don
t
want
to
talk
to
you
you
don
t
count
now
the
master
is
at
hand
.
the
attendant
thinks
it
is
some
sudden
form
of
religious
mania
which
has
seized
him
.
if
so
,
we
must
look
out
for
squalls
,
for
a
strong
man
with
homicidal
and
religious
mania
at
once
might
be
dangerous
.
the
combination
is
a
dreadful
one
.
at
nine
o
clock
i
visited
him
myself
.
his
attitude
to
me
was
the
same
as
that
to
the
attendant
in
his
sublime
self
feeling
the
difference
between
myself
and
attendant
seemed
to
him
as
nothing
.
it
looks
like
religious
mania
,
and
he
will
soon
think
that
he
himself
is
god
.
these
infinitesimal
distinctions
between
man
and
man
are
too
paltry
for
an
omnipotent
being
.
how
these
madmen
give
themselves
away
!
the
real
god
taketh
heed
lest
a
sparrow
fall
but
the
god
created
from
human
vanity
sees
no
difference
between
an
eagle
and
a
sparrow
.
oh
,
if
men
only
knew
!
for
half
an
hour
or
more
renfield
kept
getting
excited
in
greater
and
greater
degree
.
i
did
not
pretend
to
be
watching
him
,
but
i
kept
strict
observation
all
the
same
.
all
at
once
that
shifty
look
came
into
his
eyes
which
we
always
see
when
a
madman
has
seized
an
idea
,
and
with
it
the
shifty
movement
of
the
head
and
back
which
asylum
attendants
come
to
know
so
well
.
he
became
quite
quiet
,
and
went
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
resignedly
,
and
looked
into
space
with
lack
lustre
eyes
.
i
thought
i
would
find
out
if
his
apathy
were
real
or
only
assumed
,
and
tried
to
lead
him
to
talk
of
his
pets
,
a
theme
which
had
never
failed
to
excite
his
attention
.
at
first
he
made
no
reply
,
but
at
length
said
testily
bother
them
all
!
i
don
t
care
a
pin
about
them
.
what
?
i
said
.
you
don
t
mean
to
tell
me
you
don
t
care
about
spiders
?
spiders
at
present
are
his
hobby
and
the
note
book
is
filling
up
with
columns
of
small
figures
.
to
this
he
answered
enigmatically
the
bride
maidens
rejoice
the
eyes
that
wait
the
coming
of
the
bride
but
when
the
bride
draweth
nigh
,
then
the
maidens
shine
not
to
the
eyes
that
are
filled
.
he
would
not
explain
himself
,
but
remained
obstinately
seated
on
his
bed
all
the
time
i
remained
with
him
.
i
am
weary
to
night
and
low
in
spirits
.
i
cannot
but
think
of
lucy
,
and
how
different
things
might
have
been
.
if
i
don
t
sleep
at
once
,

i
must
be
careful
not
to
let
it
grow
into
a
habit
.
no
,
i
shall
take
none
to
night
!
i
have
thought
of
lucy
,
and
i
shall
not
dishonour
her
by
mixing
the
two
.
if

later
.
glad
i
made
the
resolution
gladder
that
i
kept
to
it
.
i
had
lain
tossing
about
,
and
had
heard
the
clock
strike
only
twice
,
when
the
night
watchman
came
to
me
,
sent
up
from
the
ward
,
to
say
that
renfield
had
escaped
.
i
threw
on
my
clothes
and
ran
down
at
once
my
patient
is
too
dangerous
a
person
to
be
roaming
about
.
those
ideas
of
his
might
work
out
dangerously
with
strangers
.
the
attendant
was
waiting
for
me
.
he
said
he
had
seen
him
not
ten
minutes
before
,
seemingly
asleep
in
his
bed
,
when
he
had
looked
through
the
observation
trap
in
the
door
.
his
attention
was
called
by
the
sound
of
the
window
being
wrenched
out
.
he
ran
back
and
saw
his
feet
disappear
through
the
window
,
and
had
at
once
sent
up
for
me
.
he
was
only
in
his
night
gear
,
and
cannot
be
far
off
.
the
attendant
thought
it
would
be
more
useful
to
watch
where
he
should
go
than
to
follow
him
,
as
he
might
lose
sight
of
him
whilst
getting
out
of
the
building
by
the
door
.
he
is
a
bulky
man
,
and
couldn
t
get
through
the
window
.
i
am
thin
,
so
,
with
his
aid
,
i
got
out
,
but
feet
foremost
,
and
,
as
we
were
only
a
few
feet
above
ground
,
landed
unhurt
.
the
attendant
told
me
the
patient
had
gone
to
the
left
,
and
had
taken
a
straight
line
,
so
i
ran
as
quickly
as
i
could
.
as
i
got
through
the
belt
of
trees
i
saw
a
white
figure
scale
